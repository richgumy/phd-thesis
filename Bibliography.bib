Compared with rigid space robots with limited degrees of freedom, soft robots exhibit apparent advantages of dexterity, adaptability, and robustness. Successes such as inflatable antennas have attracted interest in soft space mechanisms. Soft robots are expected to have a role in future on‐orbit missions and planetary exploration. The development of space robots is vital to broadening human cognitive boundaries. Space robots have been deployed in space science experiments, extravehicular operations, and deep space exploration. The application of space robots undoubtedly reduces the risk and cost of space activities. Traditional space robots primarily utilize rigid structures, resulting in limited degrees of freedom, which restricts their operational capabilities. In contrast, soft robots with greater flexibility and robustness may be used for future space exploration. Soft robots applied in space environments must overcome significant challenges associated with ultrahigh vacuum, microgravity, extreme temperatures, and high‐energy radiation. Herein, a comprehensive analysis of the key advantages of soft robots is presented based on the special requirements of the space environments for soft robots. Furthermore, brief insights into how soft robots must be changed in terms of their design, modeling, fabrication, sensing, and control to adapt to space environments are discussed. Specifically, soft robot scenarios with potential space application value are introduced. Finally, opinions regarding the potential directions of soft space robots are provided.},

	abstract     = {In the 21st century, robotics has been revolutionized by a new perspective: robots made of soft materials mimicking nature show several advantages compared to hard robot counterparts, leading to the birth and quick spread of a new scientific field named soft robotics. Due to the unconventional materials used in soft robotics (not only soft materials but also conductive, magnetic, and other materials employed for soft robot actuation), the manufacturing process is the basis by which to obtain soft structures able to meet specific requirements and save time and cost. The present paper aims to give a review of the current use of additive manufacturing (AM) methods for the manufacturing of soft robots. AM, also known as 3D printing, is characterized by several features, such as the possibility to easily produce very complex geometries, which are well suited for soft robot fabrication. The authors, after providing a summary of the most used actuation systems in soft robots, classify the use of AM technologies in soft robotics, investigating the most important and recent works in this field, as a function of how these technologies are employed in the whole soft robot manufacturing cycle. With this in mind, the authors found three approaches to exploit AM in soft robotics: rapid mold fabrication (AM plays a passive role), hybrid (AM plays an active role but manufacturing technologies other than AM are still used), and total additive manufacturing (only AM technologies are used). Only the latter approach takes full advantage of AM, although the other two still provide benefits. With new developments in commercial 3D printing systems (machines and materials) aimed at the fabrication of soft and unconventional parts, AM is set to become the manufacturing technology of the future in the soft robotics field, overcoming traditional manufacturing methods such as molding and soft lithography.},

Fabrication of soft robots is currently challenging and highly time- and labor-intensive. Recent advancements in three-dimensional (3D) printing of soft materials and multi-materials have become the key to enable direct manufacturing of soft robots with sophisticated designs and functions. Hence, this paper aims to review the current 3D printing processes and materials for soft robotics applications, as well as the potentials of 3D printing technologies on 3D printed soft robotics. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews the polymer 3D printing techniques and materials that have been used for the development of soft robotics. Current challenges to adopting 3D printing for soft robotics are also discussed. Next, the potentials of 3D printing technologies and the future outlooks of 3D printed soft robotics are presented. Findings: This paper reviews five different 3D printing techniques and commonly used materials. The advantages and disadvantages of each technique for the soft robotic application are evaluated. The typical designs and geometries used by each technique are also summarized. There is an increasing trend of printing shape memory polymers, as well as multiple materials simultaneously using direct ink writing and material jetting techniques to produce robotics with varying stiffness values that range from intrinsically soft and highly compliant to rigid polymers. Although the recent work is done is still limited to experimentation and prototyping of 3D printed soft robotics, additive manufacturing could ultimately be used for the end-use and production of soft robotics. Originality/value: The paper provides the current trend of how 3D printing techniques and materials are used particularly in the soft robotics application. The potentials of 3D printing technology on the soft robotic applications and the future outlooks of 3D printed soft robotics are also presented.},

We propose an optical high-resolution multimodal sensing approach, which does not require integrating multiple sensors. This approach is based on the combination of an optical scattering phenomenon, which can encode the information of various stimuli as a speckle pattern, and a decoding technique using deep learning. We demonstrate the simultaneous sensing of three different physical quantities—contact force, contact location, and temperature—with a single soft material. Another unique capability of the proposed approach is spatially continuous sensing with an ultrahigh resolution of few tens of micrometers, in contrast to previous multimodal sensing approaches. Furthermore, a haptic soft device is presented for a human–machine interface. Our approach encourages the development of high-performance smart skin-like sensors.},

Here, we present a soft tactile sensor with self-decoupling and super-resolution abilities by designing a sinusoidally magnetized flexible film (with the thickness ~0.5 millimeters), whose deformation can be detected by a Hall sensor according to the change of magnetic flux densities under external forces. The sensor can accurately measure the normal force and the shear force (demonstrated in one dimension) with a single unit and achieve a 60-fold super-resolved accuracy enhanced by deep learning. By mounting our sensor at the fingertip of a robotic gripper, we show that robots can accomplish challenging tasks such as stably grasping fragile objects under external disturbance and threading a needle via teleoperation.

This comprises a linear array of up to 32 electrodes connected through a multicore cable to a computer controlled switching module and a resistivity meter. The processing of the measured sections to produce two-dimensional true resistivity images of the subsurface is briefly described. Some account is given of the capabilities and limitations of the technique. This is illustrated by a series of computed constant separation traverses for models of simple subsurface structures. Examples of processed images derived from sections measured in areas of relatively complex geology follow, a comparison being made of the interpretations obtained using an automatic imaging method and a manual iterative approach. It is concluded that with the equipment and software so far developed, in areas of modest subsurface geological complexity where some control is available and where the structures are essentially two-dimensional, then good approximations to the true geoelectric sections can be obtained down to depths of between 100 and 200 m. © 1993.},

A total of four ERT profiles were examined using the gradient configuration, chosen for its practical advantages over other configurations. The study revealed that all profiles were situated within similar geological environments, characterized by comparable rock types. However, notable disparities were observed in lithological variations, particularly in the texture of rocks encountered at different locations and in the thicknesses of the encountered geo-electric layers. The two-dimensional inversion results derived from the electrical resistivity data unveiled the presence of four geo-electrical layers. The first layer was interpreted as sand dunes. The second layer exhibited relatively higher resistivity values, indicating the presence of compact limestone and sandstone. The resistivity of the third layer suggested the existence of a lower resistivity layer, interpreted as weathered limestone, while the fourth layer demonstrated very low inverted resistivity, interpreted as sandy clay with sandstone. The ERT models constructed for the survey area effectively delineated the aquifer zone, represented by layer 3, which likely consists of weathered limestone, sandy clay, and sandstone. The resistivity values obtained for the aquifer zone, specifically at depths ranging from 200 to 300 m, were relatively low, suggesting that the groundwater quality is brackish in nature. © 2023 by the authors.},

Despite this awareness, tactile sensors failed to be strongly adopted in industrial or consumer markets. In this paper, previous expectations of tactile sensors have been reviewed and the reasons for their failure to meet these expectations are discussed. The evolution of different tactile transduction principles, state of art designs and fabrication methods, and their pros and cons, are analyzed. From current development trends, new application areas for tactile sensors have been proposed. Literature from the last few decades has been revisited, and areas which are not appropriate for the use of tactile sensors have been identified. Similarly, the challenges that this technology needs to overcome in order to find its place in the market have been highlighted. © 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

But, the composites show an excellent repeatability of piezoresistivity under cyclic compression, no matter with low filler content or with high filler content.

The structure consists of stretchable piezoresistive strain-sensing layers over foam layers of different stiffness, allowing for both sufficient sensitivity and pressure range for human contacts. Strip-shaped sensors were used in this architecture to produce a deformation response proportional to pressure. The roles of the foam layers were elucidated by changing their stiffness and thickness, allowing the development of a geometric model to account for indenter interactions with the structure. The advantage of this architecture over other approaches is the ability to easily tune performance by adjusting the stiffness or thickness of the foams to tailor the response for different applications. Since viscoelastic materials were used, the temporal effects were also investigated.},

A pressure mapping system has been developed in this work that uses a carbon black silicone rubber (CBSR) nanoparticle sensing domain, giving the sensing domain a comparable softness to human skin tissue. To take this technology into a commercial application the performance of such an EIT-based sensor must be quantifiable and repeatable. In this work a series of experiments were repeated for various load locations, strains, and carbon black percentages. Capturing this data gave insight into the how the sensing domain performs over time and captured the transient events limiting the sensor. Metrics were determined to quantify the sensor’s spatial resolution. Load localisation could be determined with error values as low as 0.67 mm. A series of randomised test loads gave similar spatial performance results to the more structured experiments. A quasi-static conductance-force model of the material was developed with an accuracy of ± 0.78 N. One important metric is temporal resolution, as it is the least quantified performance metric in literature, however can be the most important for some applications. For the sensor domains tested, average settling times of between 19.0 – 44.5 s and 22.5 – 36.0 s were determined for 8 and 9 wt% CBSR samples. This sensor platform shows promise for future soft surface pressure mapping applications. Further use of the developed performance metrics will allow for a variety of sensor applications to be validated.}

Depending on the material used, these electrodes often possess predictable piezo-resistive properties. Combining electrical impedance tomography (EIT) with a dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) is investigated in this work to map compressive forces occurring throughout the electrode surfaces. This technology could allow for enhanced closed-loop control of electroactive actuators, extending their already extensive set of applications. This deformation mapping system also has the potential to be used with other piezoresistive materials, opening up more applications requiring a large hardness range and pressure sensitivity. With the material used in this work, the DEA-EIT device has an inherent trade-off between actuation and pressure mapping accuracy driven by the compliant electrode thickness of the DEA. The DEA-EIT device exhibited actuation strains of 2.5 % with a mean centre-of-mass error from a range of loads applied were 7.9 ± 0.7 mm for 2 mm thick DEA electrodes. It is proposed that future work on custom hardware could be devised for the DEA-EIT system so the sensing and actuation can occur concurrently in real-time. Real-time control mean that applications requiring human-like manipulation can be designed, ranging from biomedical implant devices to agricultural processing equipment.}

Therefore, we reviewed the literature dedicated to this topic over the past six decades. We present the experimental evidences, which characterize the Mullins softening. The phenomenon is observed in filled rubbers and crystallizing pure gum. Then, the phenomenological models dedicated to fit the mechanical behavior of rubbers undergoing some Mullins softening are studied. To overcome the limit of a descriptive phenomenological modeling, several authors looked for a physical understanding of the phenomenon. Various theories have been proposed, but none of them has been supported unanimously. Nonetheless, these theories favor the emergence of physically based mechanical behavior laws. We tested some of these laws, which show little predictive abilities since the values of their parameters either cannot be measured experimentally or do not compare well with the physical quantities they are linked to. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect that electrode thickness and conductivity has on the static and dynamic properties of the DE is investigated, including the electromechanical deformation of DE membrane and the voltage loaded across the thickness direction. It is found that the electromechanical deformation and voltage across the DE membrane gradually reduce with increasing electrode thickness and decreasing electrode conductivity. Resonance characteristics of the DE for varying electrode thickness and conductivity are also analyzed. The results demonstrate that electrodes with minimal thickness and high conductivity mitigate the resonant frequency and enhance the vibration intensity of the DE system.},

Planar actuators were realised with a 50 μm-thick film of an acrylic elastomer coated with compliant electrodes. The isotonic transverse strain, the isometric transverse stress and the driving current, due to a 2s high voltage impulse, were measured for four electrode materials (thickened electrolyte solution, graphite spray, carbon grease and graphite powder), four transverse prestress values (19.6, 29.4, 39.2 and 49.0 kPa) and different driving voltages (up to the dielectric breakdown voltage). Results showed that the electrode material and prestress strongly influence the electromechanical performances of the devices. Actuators with graphite spray electrodes and transverse prestress of 39.2 kPa exhibited an isotonic transverse strain of 6% at 49 V/μm, with a driving current per unit electrode area of 3.5 μ A/cm2, and an isometric transverse stress of 49 kPa at 42 V/μm. An electromechanical coupling efficiency of 10% at 21 V/μm was calculated for actuators with thickened electrolyte solution electrodes and a transverse prestress of 29.4 kPa. The presented data permits to choose the best electrode material and the best prestress value (among those tested), to obtain the maximum isotonic transverse strain, the maximum isometric transverse stress or the maximum efficiency for different ranges of applied electric field. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract     = {This book describes one of the most promising classes of polymer-based smart materials and technologies for electromechanical transducers and "pseudo-muscular" actuation devices to be used in a very broad range of applications, spanning from robotics and automation to the biomedical field. This class of materials, known as "dielectric elastomers", belong to the larger family of so-called ElectroActive Polymers (EAP), currently being developed and studied as "artificial muscles". Dielectric elastomer actuation is drawing a particular interest because of its promise of simple and robust low-cost devices with overall performance exceeding most conventional technologies, such as electromagnetics and piezoelectrics. In fact, dielectric elastomer actuators have demonstrated strain and energy density exceeding that of all high-speed field-activated actuation technologies. Further, in addition to actuation, dielectric elastomers have also been shown to offer unique possibilities for improved generator and sensing devices. Dielectric elastomer transduction was introduced during the 1990s, pioneered by SRI International. Although the field is still being explored and expanded extensively, a great deal of work has already been done, with encouraging results. This technology is enabling today an enormous range of applications that were not possible with any other EAP or smart-material technology until a few years ago. For interested readers, this book is expected to provide a comprehensive and updated insight on this technology. The book covers all the fundamental aspects, comprising a collection of chapters written by the fathers of this technology, along with the most renowned international contributors in the field. The presented topics range from transduction principles, basic materials properties, design of devices, material and device modelling, up to possible applications and future research avenues. Such an extension of the covered topics is expected to make this text as the first reference handbook on dielectric elastomer transduction. Book jacket. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.}

Joseph, Electrostriction of polymer dielectrics with compliant electrodes as a means of actuation, Sens. Actuators A 64 (1998) 77-85] is commonly used for the calculation of the electrostatic forces in dielectric elastomer systems. This equation is analyzed here with (i) energy consideration and (ii) numerical calculations of charge and force distribution. A new physical interpretation of the electrostatic forces acting on the dielectric elastomer film is proposed, with contributions from in-plane and out-of-plane stresses. Representation of this force distribution using Pelrine's equation is valid for an incompressible material, such as the acrylic elastomer VHB 4910. Experiments are performed for the measurement of the dielectric constant εr of the acrylic elastomer VHB 4910 for different film deformations. The values of εr are shown to decrease with increasing pre-stretch ratio λp, from 4.7 for the un-stretched film, down to 2.6 for equi-biaxial deformation with λp = 5. This result is important in that it corrects the constant value of 4.7 largely applied in literature for pre-stretched dielectric elastomer actuator modeling. With the results of this work the predictive capabilities of a model describing the three-dimensional passive and active actuator behavior are remarkably improved. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The energy density of DE is proportional to their dielectric constant (ε r ), therefore an understanding of the dielectric constant and how it can be influenced by the stretch state of the material is required to predict or optimize DE device behavior. DE often operate in a stretched state. Wissler and Mazza, Kofod et al., and Choi et al. all measured an er of approximately 4.7 for virgin VHB, but their results for prestretched DE showed that the dielectric constant decayed to varying degrees. Ma and Cross measured a dielectric constant of 6 for the same material with no mention of prestretch. In an attempt to resolve this discrepancy, ε r measurements were performed on parallel plate capacitors consisting of virgin and stretched VHB4905 tape electroded with either gold sputtered coatings or Nyogel 756G carbon grease. For an unstretched VHB tape, an ε r of 4.5 was measured with both electrode types, but the measured ε r of equibiaxially stretched carbon specimens was lower by between 10 to 15%. The dielectric constant of VHB under high fields was assessed using blocked force measurements from a dielectric elastomer actuator. Dielectric constants ranging from 4.6-6 for stretched VHB were calculated using the blocked force tests. Figure of merits for DE generators and actuators that incorporate their nonlinear behavior were used to assess the sensitivity of these systems to the dielectric constant. © 2009 SPIE.}

In this paper, we show how capacitive self-sensing can be used to drive a DEA in closed-loop without the need for any external sensor. The method has been demonstrated on a DEA tunable grating based on a VHB acrylic and silicone membrane. The results show that the widely used VHB presents a time-dependent drift between the capacitance of the electrodes and their strain. The silicone-based grating does not exhibit such a drift, and its strain can be stabilized by regulating the capacitance of the device to a constant value. We also report on an new fabrication method for thin deformable gratings based on replication on a water-soluble master and a 27% change in the grating period has been obtained on a VHB-based device. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

So far, its effect on the actuation phenomena has not been discussed sufficiently, although its strong dependency on prestrain is a significant drawback as an actuator. Recent observations clarifies that prestrain has the following pros and cons: prestrain plays an important role in generating large strain, whereas it rather contributes to the reduction of the strain. Prestrain provides the advantages of improving the response speed, increase of the breakdown voltage, and removing the boundary constraint caused by the inactive actuation area of the actuator. On the contrary, the elastic forces by prestrain makes the deformation smaller and the induced stress relaxation is severely detrimental as an actuator. Also, the permittivity decreases as prestrain goes up, which adds an adverse effect because the strain is proportional to the permittivity. In the present work, a comprehensive study on the effects of prestrain is performed. The key parameters affecting the overall performances are extracted and it is experimentally validated how they work on the actuation performance.}

Also, the uniaxial electro-mechanically coupled cyclic deformation of VHB 4905 DE presents a strong rate-dependence and remarkable stress-level-dependence. Based on the experimental results, an electro-mechanically coupled visco-hyperelastic constitutive model is proposed by considering the remarkable nonlinear viscosity of VHB 4905 DE and the effect of applied voltage on the cyclic deformation. Comparing the predicted results with correspondent experimental data, it is concluded that the proposed constitutive model reasonably reproduces the uniaxial electro-mechanically coupled cyclic deformation of VHB 4905 DE, including the cyclic softening and ratchetting.},

Dielectric elastomers (DE), a subcategory of these smart materials, have been of particular interest due to their large achievable deformation and favourable mechanical and electro-mechanical properties. Previous work has been completed to understand the behaviour of these materials; however, their properties require further investigation to properly integrate them into real-world applications. In this study, a biaxial tensile experimental evaluation of 3M™ VHB 4905 and VHB 4910 is presented with the purpose of illustrating the elastomers’ transversely isotropic mechanical behaviours. These tests were applied to both tapes for equibiaxial stretch rates ranging between 0.025 and 0.300 s−1. Subsequently, a dynamic planar biaxial visco-hyperelastic constitutive relationship was derived from a Kelvin–Voigt rheological model and the general Hooke’s law for transversely isotropic materials. The model was then fitted to the experimental data to obtain three general material parameters for either tapes. The model’s ability to predict tensile stress response and internal energy dissipation, with respect to experimental data, is evaluated with good agreement. The model’s ability to predict variations in mechanical behaviour due to changes in kinematic variables is then illustrated for different conditions.},

The work presents the first use of the PIλDμ control for a dielectric elastomer actuator to eliminate the overshoot. The mathematical model of the dielectric elastomer was established using the fractional Kelvin-Voigt model. Step responses are first tested in the Laplace domain, which gave the most satisfactory results. However, they did not represent the real model. It cannot have negative force acting on the dielectric elastomer actuator. Simulations in Matlab/Simulink were performed to obtain more realistic responses, where output of the PIλDμ controller was limited. Initial parameters for a PID control were obtained by the Wang–Juang–Chan algorithm for the first order plus death time function approximation to the step response of the model, and reused as the basis for the PIλDμ actuator control. A quasi-anti-windup method was introduced to the final control algorithm. Step responses of the PID and the PIλDμ in different domains were verified by simulation and validated by experiments. Experiments proved that the fractional calculus PIλDμ step responses exceeded performance of the basic PID controller for DEA in terms of response time, settling time, and overshoot elimination.},

In this work, dielectric properties of a VHB 4905 tape with different prestrains were studied using low-field broadband dielectric spectroscopy and high-field electric displacement-electric field loop measurements. The dielectric constant first increased (below 200% prestrain) and then decreased (above 200% prestrain) upon increasing the prestrain. Electroactuation of prestrained VHB films was studied using both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) driving fields. Only the AC actuation method could be used to subtract the creep contribution and obtain reversible Maxwellian actuation. In addition to removing the boundary constraint, prestrain had more influence on the actuation property of VHB. The Young's modulus reached the minimum level (∼0.05 MPa) between 100% and 400% areal prestrain, and increasing the prestrain could enhance electroactuation. Above 500% prestrain, the electroactuation started to decrease because of significant strain-hardening in the sample. Different nonlinear mechanical models were used to fit the experimental data of electroactuation. This study provides a viable standard for the future investigation of reversible Maxwellian actuation in various dielectric elastomers.},

Conceptually, the proposed function is a material model with a shear modulus which varies with deformation. This contrasts with the neo-Hookean and Mooney-Rivlin models which have a constant shear modulus. The variation of shear modulus with deformation is commonly observed with filled rubbers. Initially, the modulus falls with increasing deformation, leading to a flattening of the shear stress/strain curve. At large deformations, the modulus rises again due to finite extensibility of the network, accentuated by the strain amplication effect of the filler. This characteristic behavior of filled rubbers may be described approximately by the proposed strain-energy function by requiring the coefficient C20 to be negative, while the coefficients C10 and C30 are positive. The use of the proposed strain-energy function has been shown to permit the prediction of stress/strain behavior in different deformation modes from data obtained in one simple deformation mode. This circumvents the need for a rather difficult experiment in general biaxial extension. The simple form of the proposed function also simplifies the regression analysis. This strain-energy function is consistent with the general Rivlin strain-energy function and is easily obtained from the popular third-order deformation approximation. Thus, it is already available in many existing finite-element analysis programs.},

This deformation can be mathematically explained by the Maxwell stress, the electrostatic pressure that results from the deposit of opposite electric charges on electrodes that sandwiches a dielectric elastomer film in typical applications. Regardless of the purpose, the dielectric constant, also called the dielectric permittivity, directly influences this deformation process. As such, its characterization for prestrain dependency would be crucial to shaping the performance of a dielectric elastomer. One of the most promising dielectric elastomer has been the polyacrylate VHB elastomer. This report shall focus on the uniaxial prestrain dependence of VHB 4905 elastomer at room temperature. Results collected from a Novocontrol High Frequency Analyzer showed that the dielectric constant decreases with increasing prestretch and frequency. It is also studied that the initial thickness of the elastomer can affect its permittivity in relaxed and non-relaxed static states. Several numerical models were applied to describe the dielectric constant of VHB 4905 elastomer. First, the prerequisite to establishing uniaxial prestretch dependency is to account for effect of temperature and frequency. This is done so using the well-known Cole-Cole empirical equation. The parameters fitted were then transferred to a second relation in product form with the Cole-Cole equation multiplying a prestretch polynomial. The inspiration for such a model has arisen from past developments where a temperature prefactor was used. The prestretch polynomial's reference values are set at a relaxed state to correspond with the Cole-Cole temperature model, though it can be modified to any other prestretch state due to numerical similarities in permittivity trends. 3},

The detected Young's modulus and dielectric permittivity of the hybrid film containing 5.82 vol% PCB increase by 613 and 244% compared to the pure film, respectively.

Triggered by a relatively low electrical field of 7.14 V/μm, the hybrid DEA exhibits better out-of-plane actuations compared to the pure DEA: 1.91-fold in flection amplitude, 2.79-fold in areal strain, and 4.35-fold in force output.},

With the development of elastic polymers and stretchable conductors, flexible and sensitive dielectric elastomer tactile sensors, similar to human skin, have been used for measuring mechanical deformations, such as pressure, strain, shear and torsion. For high sensitivity and fast response, air gaps and microstructural dielectric layers are employed in pressure sensors or multiaxial force sensors. Multimodal dielectric elastomer sensors have been reported that can detect mechanical deformation but can also sense temperature, humidity, as well as chemical and biological stimulation in human-activity monitoring and personal healthcare. Hence, dielectric elastomer sensors have great potential for applications in soft robotics, wearable devices, medical diagnostic and structural health monitoring, because of their large deformation, low cost, ease of fabrication and ease of integration into monitored structures.},

By rolling highly prestrained electroelastomer films around a compression spring, we have demonstrated multifunctional electroelastomer rolls (MERs, or spring rolls) that combine load bearing, actuation, and sensing functions. We extended the design to two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) and 3-DOF spring rolls by patterning the electrodes to align radially on two and four circumferential spans of the rolls, respectively. Multiple-DOF spring rolls retain the linear actuation of 1-DOF spring rolls with additional bending actuation. Mathematical equations are derived to correlate the bending angle and lateral force of the rolls with the actuated stroke in one of the electroded spans. Two-DOF spring rolls with a 1.4 cm outside diameter, 6.8 cm axial length, and 11 g weight have been fabricated; these rolls have a 90 • maximum actuation bending angle, 0.7 N maximum lateral force, and up to 15 N blocked axial force. Three-DOF spring rolls with a 2.3 cm outside diameter, 9.0 cm axial length, and 29 g weight exhibit a 35 • maximum bending angle and 1.0 N maximum lateral force. These specifications can be modified by variations in roll parameters according to the equations. Multi-DOF spring rolls are easy to fabricate, compact, multifunctional, and mechanically robust. They represent a radically new actuation technology and may enable a number of unique applications. We have demonstrated a small walking robot, MERbot, with one 2-DOF spring roll as each of its six legs. The robot's speed is as high as 13.6 cm s −1 or two-thirds of its length per second. 'Sushi rolls' have also been fabricated: these consist of six 2-DOF springs connected in series and monolithic in structure.

	abstract     = {If an elastomeric material is subjected to sufficiently large deformations, it eventually fractures. There are two typical micromechanisms of failure in such materials: chain scission and crosslink failure. The chain scission failure mode is mainly observed in polymers with strong covalent crosslinks, while the crosslink failure mode is observed in polymers with weak crosslinks. In two recent papers, we have proposed a theory for progressive damage and rupture of polymers with strong covalent crosslinks. In this paper, we extend our previous framework and formulate a theory for modeling failure of elastomeric materials with weak crosslinks. We first introduce a model for the deformation of a single chain with weak crosslinks at each of its two ends using statistical mechanics arguments, and then upscale the model from a single chain to the continuum level for a polymer network. Finally, we introduce a damage variable to describe the progressive damage and failure of polymer networks. A central feature of our theory is the recognition that the free energy of elastomers is not entirely entropic in nature; there is also an energetic contribution from the deformation of the backbone bonds in a chain and/or the crosslinks. For polymers with weak crosslinks, this energetic contribution is mainly from the deformation of the crosslinks. It is this energetic part of the free energy which is the driving force for progressive damage and fracture of elastomeric materials. Moreover, we show that for elastomeric materials in which fracture occurs by crosslink stretching and scission, the classical Lake-Thomas scaling - that the toughness Gc of an elastomeric material is proportional to 1/G0, with G0=NκBγ the ground-state shear modulus of the material - does not hold. A new scaling is proposed, and some important consequences of this scaling are remarked upon.},

	abstract     = {When dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are actuated via high voltage, their electrical capacitance changes according to the geometry. Therefore, displacement of the actuator can be correlated to the change in capacitance, thus opening up the possibility of self-sensing DEA devices. Self-sensing can be exploited to achieve a sensorless closed loop DEA system, which is attractive from size, weight, and cost perspectives. This research work presents an embedded control system, which enables self-sensing closed loop position control of a DEA. The proposed architecture is cost effective, compact in size, easy to integrate as well as to reprogram in comparison to previous self-sensing implementations relying on FPGA systems. In the developed setup, the online self-sensing algorithm is used for estimation of displacement in a spring-biased strip DEA. For this system, understanding and mapping the correlation between estimated capacitance, applied voltage, and resulting displacement is essential for achieving an accurate DEA position reconstruction. An experimental setup is developed, and used to test a spring-biased DEA system. Self-sensing based feedback control is then used to achieve a tight regulation of the actuator displacement. To verify the effectiveness of the sensorless closed loop control system, its performance is finally compared to sensor-based feedback architectures.},

	abstract     = {Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are an emerging type of soft actuation technology. As a fundamental unit of a DEA, the characteristics of compliant electrodes play a crucial role in the actuation performances of DEAs. Generally, the compliant electrodes can be categorized into uncured and cured types, of which the cured one commonly involves mixing conductive particles into an elastomeric matrix before curing, thus demonstrating a better long-term performance. Along with the increasing proportion of conductive particles, the electrical conductivity increases at the cost of a stiffer electrode and lower elongation at break ratio. For different DEA applications, it can be more desirable to minimize the electrode stiffness or to maximize its conductivity. In examination of the papers published in recent years, few works have characterized the effects of elastomeric electrodes on the outputs of DEAs, or of their optimizations under different application scenarios. In this work, we propose an experimental framework to characterize the performances of elastomeric electrodes with different formulas based on the two key parameters of stiffness and conductivity. An optimizing method is developed and verified by two different application cases (e.g., quasi-static and dynamic). The findings and the methods developed in this work can offer potential approaches for developing high-performance DEAs.},

Time-dependent piezoresistance was investigated as a function of concentration. In the quasi-static case, a transition from negative pressure coefficient to positive pressure coefficient (PPC) behavior was observed. The PPC effect was negligible at high concentrations. At short times, the resistive response decreased for all nanocomposites, with the magnitude of the decrease proportionate to the MWCNT concentration. However, long-term creep response was resistive for low concentrations and conductive at high concentrations. A Burgers model based on Maxwell and Kelvin elements in series was used to describe the strain dependence. An equivalent model that uses resistances and capacitances was examined for the time dependence of fractional resisitivity. Results were correlated with Raman mapping-based dispersion analysis. An increased dispersion and an increase in MWCNT–MWCNT contact area resulted in a transition from a matrix-based resistive response to a filler-based conductive response. Time-dependent piezoresistance was investigated as a function of carbon nanotube (CNT) concentration in polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/CNT composites. For quasi-static loading and long-term creep, the electrical response of the composites has been studied. An equivalent Burgers model was used to describe strain dependence and fractional resistivity time dependence. Raman spectroscopy was used to correlate the dispersion of CNT in polymer matrix and resistance response.},

With increasing strain to the maximum value, 3%, the responsivity (ΔR/R0, R0 is the original resistance, ΔR is instantaneous change in resistance) increased in exponential and linear fashion for CB/PP and CNTs/PP, respectively, the phenomenon was explained by the tunneling theory. More interestingly, when 10 extension-retraction cycles were applied, for CB/PP, values of max and min ΔR/R0 increased gradually with increasing the cycle number; while for CNTs/PP, max and min ΔR/R0 values became more and more negative. It is suggested that the difference mainly depends on the distinction in the microstructure of conductive fillers, the interaction between fillers and matrix and the hysteresis effect resulting from viscoelastic behavior of composites.

The piezoresistive behavior has been realized in an electrically conductive elastomer composite where the micro structure of conductive fillers can be changed under finite deformation of elastomer, resulting in the change of the composite resistivity. In this paper, we analyze the piezoresistive behavior of a conductive short fiber/elastomer matrix composite by applying a percolation model. Fiber reorientation model is applied to the composite system with the aim of predicting the relation between the applied finite strain and the reorientation of conductive short fibers. It is found that the piezoresistive behavior of a conductive short fiber/elastomer composite is attributed to the degeneration of initially percolating network under the finite strain. Some numerical results are then compared with our previous experimental data, showing a reasonably good agreement. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Elucidating the timing of diversification among the more than 70 lineages is key to understanding the evolution of eukaryotes. Here, we use taxon-rich multigene data combined with diverse fossils and a relaxed molecular clock framework to estimate the timing of the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes and the divergence of major clades. Overall, these analyses suggest that the last common ancestor lived between 1866 and 1679 Ma, consistent with the earliest microfossils interpreted with confidence as eukaryotic. During this interval, the Earth's surface differed markedly from today; for example, the oceans were incompletely ventilated, with ferruginous and, after about 1800 Ma, sulfidic water masses commonly lying beneath moderately oxygenated surface waters. Our time estimates also indicate that the major clades of eukaryotes diverged before 1000 Ma, with most or all probably diverging before 1200 Ma. Fossils, however, suggest that diversity within major extant clades expanded later, beginning about 800 Ma, when the oceans began their transition to a more modern chemical state. In combination, paleontological and molecular approaches indicate that long stems preceded diversification in the major eukaryotic lineages.},

	abstract     = {It is widely accepted that multicellular animals (metazoans) constitute a monophyletic unit, deriving from ancestral choanoflagellate-like protists that gave rise to simple choanocyte-bearing metazoans. However, a re-assessment of molecular and histological evidence on choanoflagellates, sponge choanocytes, and other metazoan cells reveals that the status of choanocytes as a fundamental cell type in metazoan evolution is unrealistic. Rather, choanocytes are specialized cells that develop from non-collared ciliated cells during sponge embryogenesis. Although choanocytes of adult sponges have no obvious homologue among metazoans, larval cells transdifferentiating into choanocytes at metamorphosis do have such homologues. The evidence reviewed here also indicates that sponge larvae are architecturally closer than adult sponges to the remaining metazoans. This may mean that the basic multicellular organismal architecture from which diploblasts evolved, that is, the putative planktonic archimetazoan, was more similar to a modern poriferan larva lacking choanocytes than to an adult sponge. Alternatively, it may mean that other metazoans evolved from a neotenous larva of ancient sponges. Indeed, the Porifera possess some features of intriguing evolutionary significance: (1) widespread occurrence of internal fertilization and a notable diversity of gastrulation modes, (2) dispersal through architecturally complex lecithotrophic larvae, in which an ephemeral archenteron (in dispherula larvae) and multiciliated and syncytial cells (in trichimella larvae) occur, (3) acquisition of direct development by some groups, and (4) replacement of choanocyte-based filter-feeding by carnivory in some sponges. Together, these features strongly suggest that the Porifera may have a longer and more complicated evolutionary history than traditionally assumed, and also that the simple anatomy of modern adult sponges may have resulted from a secondary simplification. This makes the idea of a neotenous evolution less likely than that of a larva-like choanocyte-lacking archimetazoan. From this perspective, the view that choanoflagellates may be simplified sponge-derived metazoans, rather than protists, emerges as a viable alternative hypothesis. This idea neither conflicts with the available evidence nor can be disproved by it, and must be specifically re-examined by further approaches combining morphological and molecular information. Interestingly, several microbial lineages lacking choanocyte-like morphology, such as Corallochytrea, Cristidiscoidea, Ministeriida, and Mesomycetozoea, have recently been placed at the boundary between fungi and animals, becoming a promising source of information in addition to the choanoflagellates in the search for the unicellular origin of animal multicellularity.},

To date, experimental studies have measured the mechanical properties of peripheral tissues (e.g. skin) in-vivo and limited internal tissues ex-vivo in cadavers (e.g. brain and the heart). The lack of knowledge on a majority of human tissues inhibit their study for applications ranging from surgical planning, ballistic testing, implantable medical device development, and the assessment of traumatic injuries. The purpose of this work is to overcome such challenges through an extensive review of the literature reporting the mechanical properties of whole-body soft tissues from head to toe. Specifically, the available linear mechanical properties of all human tissues were compiled. Non-linear biomechanical models were also introduced, and the soft human tissues characterized using such models were summarized. The literature gaps identified from this work will help future biomechanical studies on soft human tissue characterization and the development of accurate medical models for the study and mitigation of injuries.},

Methods: The EIT system consists of a PC in which an I/O card is installed with an external current generator, a multiplexer, a power supply and a phantom with an array of electrodes. The measurement system provides 12-bit accuracy and hence, suitable data acquisition software has been prepared accordingly. The synchronous phase detection method has been implemented for voltage measurement. Different methods of image reconstruction have been used with this instrument to generate electrical conductivity images. Results: The results of simulation and real measurement of the system are presented. The reconstruction programs were written in MATLAB and the data acquisition software in C++. The system has been tested with both static and dynamic mode in a 2-D domain. Better results have been produced in the dynamic mode of operation, due to the cancellation of errors. Conclusion: In the spirit of open access publication the design details of this simple EIT system are made available here. © 2006 Soleimani; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract     = {Lung EIT is a functional imaging method that utilizes electrical currents to reconstruct images of conductivity changes inside the thorax. This technique is radiation free and applicable at the bedside, but lacks of spatial resolution compared to morphological imaging methods such as X-ray computed tomography (CT). In this article we describe an approach for EIT image reconstruction using morphologic information obtained from other structural imaging modalities. This leads to recon- structed images of lung ventilation that can easily be superimposed with structural CT or MRI images, which facilitates image interpretation. The approach is based on a Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) of an image of the considered transversal thorax slice. The use of DCT enables reduction of the dimensionality of the reconstruction and ensures that only conductivity changes of the lungs are reconstructed and displayed. The DCT based approach is well suited to fuse morphological image information with functional lung imaging at low computational costs. Results on simulated data indicate that this approach preserves the morphological structures of the lungs and avoids blurring of the solution. Images from patient measurements reveal the capabilities of the method and demonstrate benefits in possible applications.},

Touch also provides us with direct access to the external world of physical objects, via haptic exploration. Furthermore, a recent area of interest in tactile research across studies of developing children and adults is its social function, mediating interpersonal bonding. Although there are a range of demonstrations of early competence with touch, particularly in the domain of haptics, the review presented here indicates that many of the tactile perceptual skills that we take for granted as adults (e.g., perceiving touches in the external world as well as on the body) take some time to develop in the first months of postnatal life, likely as a result of an extended process of connection with other sense modalities which provide new kinds of information from birth (e.g., vision and audition). Here, we argue that because touch is of such fundamental importance across a wide range of social and cognitive domains, it should be placed much more centrally in the study of early perceptual development than it currently is.},

In this paper, we present a newly developed conductive structure which is pressure sensitive but stretch insensitive and is based on the concept of contact resistance between (1)a network of stretchable wave-like conductive yarns with high resistance and (2)a conductive stretchable sheet with low resistance. Based on this newly developed structure, we have realized a novel tactile distribution sensor which enables stable measurement under dynamic and large stretch from various directions. Stable measurement of pressure distribution under dynamic and complex deformation cases such as pinching and pushing on a balloon surface are demonstrated. The sensor has been originally designed for implementation over interactive robots with soft and highly deformable bodies, but can also be used as novel user interface devices, or ordinary pressure distribution sensors. Some of the most remarkable specifications of the developed tactile sensor are high stretchability up to 140% and toughness under adverse load conditions. The sensor also has a realistic potential of becoming as thin and stretchable as stocking fabric. A goal of this research is to combine this thin sensor with stretch distribution sensors so that richer and moresophisticated tactile interactions can be realized. ©2009 IEEE.},

A separate line of research has reported that fast eye movements known as saccades allow simple modulated LEDs to be observed at very high rates. Here we show that humans perceive visual flicker artifacts at rates over 500 Hz when a display includes high frequency spatial edges. This rate is many times higher than previously reported. As a result, modern display designs which use complex spatio-temporal coding need to update much faster than conventional TVs, which traditionally presented a simple sequence of natural images.},

The results of this numerical analysis showed that SH is significantly more sensitive to changes in skin thickness, relatively to subcutaneous tissue, but equally sensitive to changes in the stiffness of either tissue. Indicatively, 25% reduction in skin thickness (0.3 mm thickness change) or in subcutaneous tissue thickness (5.9 mm thickness change), reduced SH by 7% or increased SH by 2% respectively. At the same time, 25% reduction in skin stiffness (10.1 MPa change in initial shear modulus) or of subcutaneous tissue (4.1 MPa change in initial shear modulus) led to 11% or 8% reduction in SH respectively. In the literature, SH is commonly used to study skin biomechanics. However, this analysis indicates that SH quantifies the deformability of bulk tissue, not of skin.

	abstract     = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an attractive method for clinically monitoring patients during mechanical ventilation, because it can provide a non-invasive continuous image of pulmonary impedance which indicates the distribution of ventilation. However, most clinical and physiological research in lung EIT is done using older and proprietary algorithms; this is an obstacle to interpretation of EIT images because the reconstructed images are not well characterized. To address this issue, we develop a consensus linear reconstruction algorithm for lung EIT, called GREIT (Graz consensus Reconstruction algorithm for EIT). This paper describes the unified approach to linear image reconstruction developed for GREIT. The framework for the linear reconstruction algorithm consists of (1) detailed finite element models of a representative adult and neonatal thorax, (2) consensus on the performance figures of merit for EIT image reconstruction and (3) a systematic approach to optimize a linear reconstruction matrix to desired performance measures. Consensus figures of merit, in order of importance, are (a) uniform amplitude response, (b) small and uniform position error, (c) small ringing artefacts, (d) uniform resolution, (e) limited shape deformation and (f) high resolution. Such figures of merit must be attained while maintaining small noise amplification and small sensitivity to electrode and boundary movement. This approach represents the consensus of a large and representative group of experts in EIT algorithm design and clinical applications for pulmonary monitoring. All software and data to implement and test the algorithm have been made available under an open source license which allows free research and commercial use. © 2009 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

It is complex to mimic key skin features using existing tactile sensors, and there exists no somatosensor that responds to real stimuli of pressure, temperature, and touch. Herein, three critical skin receptors created by realizing integrated electronic systems that mimic the feedback response of somatosensors are experimentally demonstrated. Fully functional Pacinian corpuscles, thermoreceptors, and nociceptors are realized using a combination of stretchable pressure sensors, phase-change oxide thin films, and threshold-based resistive switching (memristor) memory elements. The ability to detect and respond to pressure, temperature, and pain stimuli above a threshold with real-life performance characteristics is demonstrated with explanation of underlying mechanisms. The ability to design and realize artificial skin receptors enables replacement of affected human skin regions, augment skin sensitivity for agile applications in defense and sports, and drive advancements in intelligent robotics.},

The sensor can be easily adapted for use in applications related to the fields of robotics, rehabilitation, or costumer electronic devices. In order to remove most of the stiff components that block the flexibility of the sensor, we based the sensing capability on the use of a tomographic technique known as Electrical Impedance Tomography. The technique allows the internal structure of the domain under study to be inferred by reconstructing its conductivity map. By applying the technique to a material that changes its resistivity according to applied forces, it is possible to identify these changes and then localise the area where the force was applied. We tested the system when applied to flat and curved surfaces. For all configurations, we evaluate the artificial skin capabilities to detect forces applied over a single point, over multiple points, and changes in the underlying geometry. The results are all promising, and open the way for the application of such sensors in different robotic contexts where deformability is the key point.},

	abstract     = {Much recent work has been devoted to utilizing changes in either the inherent or imparted electrical conductivity of self-sensing materials as an indicator of damage, deformation or strain, pressure, or general condition (e.g. moisture content, UV exposure, pH, etc). The scope of self-sensing materials is quite large and includes polymeric composites, cementitious and ceramic materials, specialized fabrics, and sensing skins or paints applied to materials which otherwise cannot be made to be self-sensing. Beyond just utilizing conductivity changes for mere detection, spatial localization and artifact shaping is highly desirable. For this, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has received much attention (also referred to as electrical resistance tomography, ERT). Because of the diversity of materials which exhibit conductivity-based self-sensing, EIT has broad, far-reaching potential in areas such as structural health monitoring (SHM) and nondestructive evaluation (NDE), human-to-robot interactions and interfacing, and even biomedical implants, prosthetic devices, and human health monitoring via wearable sensor technology. Historically, EIT was developed for biomedical imaging and geophysical prospection-vast literature exists in these areas. However, new applications of EIT in conjunction with stimulus-responsive conductivity in engineered materials poses new challenges and new opportunities not seen in biomedical and geophysical applications. Therefore, a comprehensive review of EIT as it has been applied for damage, deformation or strain, pressure, and condition monitoring is herein presented in order to provide the reader with a perspective of results to date, best practices, and a road map for future development of this exciting technology.},

	abstract     = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is widely used for functional imaging of the bio-impedance of body parts for various applications, such as lung ventilation monitoring [1]. It was recently shown that 'fast neural EIT' with far enhanced temporal resolution (frame rate) can provide the neural activity monitoring and functional localization of the active peripheral nerve at the same time [2]. In an EIT system, to reconstruct an impedance tomography image (Fig. 1(a)), an AC current is injected from a current generator (ICG) into the target bioimpedance network ZBIO through an electrode pair (channel) in a rotational manner, while demodulating the voltages appeared at all the other channels. The I/Q demodulation is the most popular way to extract the resistance and reactance information of ZBIO [1]. For the neural EIT, however, this method cannot support a high enough frame rate, failing to acquire neural activities, mainly due to the downconversion to DC and low-pass filtering. As shown in Fig. 1(a), many cycles of the AC input signal are needed for the I and Q outputs to be well settled to their final values. A higher excitation frequency (fCG) can be used for faster settling in conventional applications, but in the neural EIT, fCG should be <20kHz for high SNR image acquisition [2]. Alternatively, peak detection can be used [3], but it needs a much faster sampling clock than fCG, consuming a large dynamic power in all the demodulation channels.}

The IC supports three operating modes; gain scanning, contact impedance monitoring, and EIT modes for the clear EIT image. A differential sinusoidal current stimulator (DSCS) is proposed for injection of low-distortion programmable current which has harmonics less than-59 dBc at a load impedance of 2 kΩ. To get high sensitivity, a 6-channel voltage sensing amplifier can adaptively control the gain up to a maximum of 60 dB, and has low input referred noise, 36 nV/\surdHz. The 2.5 × 5 mm chip is fabricated in a 0.18 μm 1P6M CMOS process and consumes 53.4 mW on average.

This paper presents a maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach to linearized image reconstruction using knowledge of the noise variance of the measurements and the covariance of the conductivity distribution. This approach has the advantage of an intuitive interpretation of the algorithm parameters as well as fast (near real time) image reconstruction. In order to compare this approach to existing algorithms, we develop figures of merit to measure the reconstructed image resolution, the noise amplification of the image reconstruction, and the fidelity of positioning in the image. Finally, we develop a communications systems approach to calculate the probability of detection of a conductivity contrast in the reconstructed hnage as a function of the measurement noise and the reconstruction algorithm used. ) ©1996 IEEE.},

The present paper is a review of some procedures that have contributed to improve spatial resolution and material properties accuracy, admitivity or impeditivity accuracy. A review of EIT medical applications is presented and they were classified into three broad categories: ARDS patients, obstructive lung diseases and perioperative patients. The use of absolute EIT image may enable the assessment of absolute lung volume, which may significantly improve clinical acceptance of EIT. The Control Theory, State Observers more specifically, have a developed theory that can be used for designing and operating EIT devices. Electrode placement, current injection strategy and electrode electric potential measurements strategy should maximize the number of observable and controllable directions of the state vector space. A non-linear stochastic state observer, the Unscented Kalman Filter, is used directly for reconstructing absolute EIT images. Historically, difference images were explored first since they are more stable in the presence of modelling errors. Absolute images require more detailed models of contact impedance, stray capacitance and properly refined finite element mesh, where the electric potential gradient is high. Parallelization of the forward program computation is necessary since the solution of the inverse problem often requires frequent solutions of the forward problem. Several reconstruction algorithms benefit from the Bayesian inverse problem approach and the concept of prior information. Anatomic and physiological information are used to form the prior information. An already tested methodology is presented to build the prior probability density function using an ensemble of CT scans and in vivo impedance measurements. Eight absolute EIT image algorithms are presented.},

The end usage is the energy storage capability because it is a trade-off between dielectric permittivity, dielectric loss, and dissipation factor. Hence, it is of prime importance to study the dielectric properties of polymer materials by adding filler material at a low-frequency range. In the present study, polydimethylsiloxane/carbon black nanocomposites are prepared using the solution cast method. The dielectric properties, such as dielectric constant, dielectric loss, and dissipation factors due to the concentration of filler particles and low-frequency effect on the nanocomposites, are examined. Also, different empirical models are used to estimate the dielectric permittivity of polymer nanocomposites. The low-frequency range of 100 Hz to 1 MHz and the effect of varying volume fractions of carbon black show a significant change in the dielectric properties. It is found that the nanocomposites have a higher dielectric permittivity than the base polymer material. It is also observed that an increase in filler concentration increases the dielectric permittivity, which is confirmed with an empirical model.},

Both graphite and carbon black were tested. Mixtures of graphite and urethane (0% to 50% by weight) provided relatively low permittivity and conductivity, suitable for mimicking fatty tissues. Mixtures of carbon black and urethane (0% to 15% by weight) provided a broad range of suitable properties. Samples with 15% carbon black had permittivity and conductivity similar to higher-water-content tissues, however the cured samples were not mechanically suitable for moulding into complex shapes. Finally, mixtures of graphite, carbon black, and urethane were created. These exhibited a range of dielectric properties and can be used to mimic a variety of soft tissues. The mechanical properties of these samples were tested and presented properties that exceed typical phantom requirements.

TMM mixtures made from polyurethane, graphite, carbon black and either acetone or isopropanol are fabricated to emulate the conductivity profiles of the reference tissues. 3D-printed anatomically realistic moulds of the head and brain are used to cast a two-layer head and brain phantom with cylindrical holes left to allow addition of phantom pathological lesions such as haemorrhages. Results. The TMM spans a wide biological range of fat to blood and is adjustable to match any target tissue. Uniquely, the material is mechanically stable and easy to mould. The fabricated head phantom has excellent anatomic realism, and can represent a healthy brain or one with pathological lesions.

	abstract     = {The measurement of regional lung ventilation by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has been evaluated in many experimental studies. However, EIT is not routinely used in a clinical setting, which is attributable to the fact that a convenient concept for how to quantify the EIT data is missing. The definition of region of interest (ROI) is an essential point in the data analysis. To date, there are only limited data available on the different approaches to ROI definition to evaluate regional lung ventilation by EIT. For this survey we examined ten patients (mean age ± SD: 60 ± 10 years) under controlled ventilation. Regional tidal volumes were quantified as pixel values of inspiratory-to-expiratory impedance differences and four types of ROIs were subsequently applied. The definition of ROI contours was based on the calculation of the pixel values of (1) standard deviation from each pixel set of impedance data and (2) the regression coefficient from linear regression equations between the individual local (pixel) and average (whole scan) impedance signals. Additionally, arbitrary ROIs (four quadrants and four anteroposterior segments of equal height) were used. Our results indicate that both approaches to ROI definition using statistical parameters are suitable when impedance signals with high sensitivity to ventilation-related phenomena are to be analyzed. The definition of the ROI contour as 20-35% of the maximum standard deviation or regression coefficient is recommended. Simple segmental ROIs are less convenient because of the low ventilation-related signal component in the dorsal region. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

A quasi-static finite-difference time-domain method was applied to analyze this problem. The motivation of our investigation is that the dependence of the electric field induced in nerve tissue on the averaging volume/distance is not clear, while a cubical volume of 5 × 5 × 5 mm3 or a straight-line segment of 5 mm is suggested in some documents. The influence of non-nerve tissue surrounding nerve tissue is also discussed by considering three algorithms for calculating the averaged in situ electric field in nerve tissue. The computational results obtained herein reveal that the volume-averaged electric field in the nerve tissue decreases with the averaging volume. In addition, the 99th percentile value of the volume-averaged in situ electric field in nerve tissue is more stable than that of the maximal value for different averaging volume. When including non-nerve tissue surrounding nerve tissue in the averaging volume, the resultant in situ electric fields were not so dependent on the averaging volume as compared to the case excluding non-nerve tissue. In situ electric fields averaged over a distance of 5 mm were comparable or larger than that for a 5 × 5 × 5 mm3 cube depending on the algorithm, nerve tissue considered and exposure scenarios. © 2010 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

	abstract     = {Enabling dexterous manipulation and safe human-robot interaction, soft robots are widely used in numerous surgical applications. One of the complications associated with using soft robots in surgical applications is reconstructing their shape and the external force exerted on them. Several sensor-based and model-based approaches have been proposed to address the issue. In this paper, a shape sensing technique based on Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is proposed. The performance of this sensing technique in predicting the tip position and contact force of a soft bending actuator is highlighted by conducting a series of empirical tests. The predictions were performed based on a data-driven approach using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. The tip position predictions indicate the importance of using EIT data along with pressure inputs. Changing the number of EIT channels, we evaluated the effect of the number of EIT inputs on the accuracy of the predictions. The least RMSE values for the tip position are 3.6 and 4.6 mm in Y and Z coordinates, respectively, which are 7.36% and 6.07% of the actuator's total range of motion. Contact force predictions were conducted in three different bending angles and by varying the number of EIT channels. The results of the predictions illustrated that increasing the number of channels contributes to higher accuracy of the force estimation. The mean errors of using 8 channels are 7.69%, 2.13%, and 2.96% of the total force range in three different bending angles.}

Understanding the mechanical degradation of PMMA-based materials is of practical importance in improving the reliability and lifespan of the associated structures and systems. In this study, we investigate the effects of functionalized graphene (FG) and UV irradiation on the stress–relaxation of PMMA. Uniaxial tensile and stress –relaxation tests are performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of the composites. The mechanical strength and elongation at the break increase with the graphene concentration but decrease with the increase of the irradiation dose. Raman spectroscopy and intrinsic viscosity measurement are applied to examine the root cause of the degradation in the composites. UV irradiation leads to polymer chain scission and loss of molecular weight. The Kelvin representation of the standard linear solid model (SLSM) is used to describe the stress–relaxation curves of the composites. The value of the elastic modulus in the Kelvin element decreases with the increase in temperature. The viscosity follows the Arrhenius equation. The activation energy of viscosity increases with the increasing FGs concentration because the FGs hinder the chain motion of PMMA. However, UV irradiation makes chain scission of PMMA/FGs composite so that the polymer chain moves more easily and the activation energy of stress relaxation lowers. The steady-state stress follows the van ’t Hoff equation that stress relaxation is an exothermal deformation process. Although Maxwell’s representation of SLSM is mathematically identical to the Kelvin representation of SLSM, the former cannot interpret the stress–relaxation behavior of PMMA/FGs composite, which is against the concept of Young’s modulus as a decreasing temperature function.},

Moreover, its low cost and high portability make it suitable for real-time, bedside monitoring. However, EIT is also characterized by some technical limitations that cause poor spatial resolution. The possibility to design wearable devices based on EIT has recently given a boost to this technology. In this paper we reviewed EIT physical principles, hardware design and major clinical applications, from the classical to a wearable setup. A wireless and wearable EIT system seems a promising frontier of this technology, as it can both facilitate making clinical measurements and open novel scenarios to EIT systems, such as home monitoring.},

Treatment of the CNT outer and inner conductors with KAuBr 4 was found to significantly reduce the attenuation of these cables, which demonstrates that chemical agents can be used to improve power transmission through CNT networks at high frequencies (150 kHz-3 GHz). For cables constructed with a KAuBr 4-treated CNT outer conductor, power attenuation per length approaches parity with cables constructed from metallic conductors at significantly lower weight per length (i.e., 7.1 g/m for CNT designs compared to 38.8 g/m for an RG-58 design). A relationship between the thickness of the CNT outer conductor and the cable attenuation was observed and used to estimate the effective skin depth at high frequency. These results establish reliable, reproducible methods for the construction of coaxial cables from CNT materials that can facilitate further investigation of their performance in high-frequency transmission structures, and highlight a specific opportunity for significant reduction in coaxial cable mass. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

The method is subsequently verified by comparing the results with those derived directly from the Maxwell's equations. Our analysis reveals for the first time that skin effect in CNT (particularly MWCNT) bundles is significantly reduced compared to that in conventional metal conductors, which makes them very attractive and promising material for high-frequency applications, including high-quality Q factor on-chip inductor design in high-performance RF/ mixed-signal circuits. It is shown that such unique high-frequency properties of CNTs essentially arise due to their large momentum relaxation time (leading to their large kinetic inductance), which causes the skin depths to saturate with frequency and thereby limits resistance increase at high frequencies in a bundle structure. It is subsequently shown that CNT-based planar spiral inductors can achieve more than three times higher Q factor than their Cu-based counterparts without using any magnetic materials or Q factor enhancement techniques. © 2009 IEEE.},

The nonlinear electric-field-dependent dc conductivity shows strong dependence on film thickness as well. Measurement of the electric field dependence of the resistance R (E) allows for the determination of a length scale LE possibly characterizing the distance between tube contacts, which is found to systematically decrease with increasing film thickness. The onset frequency ω0 of ac conductivity and the length scale LE of SWCNT networks are found to be correlated, and a physically reasonable empirical formula relating them has been proposed.

A wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD)-based quantitative phase analysis method was used to characterize the variations of the concentrations of the insulating binder and the conductive particles around their mean values as a function of mixing time in an intensive batch mixer. Increasing the time and hence, the specific energy input, during the mixing process results in a more homogeneous spatial distribution of the conductive filler in the polymeric matrix, which in turn results in a decrease of the volume conductivity of the composite. The decreasing conductivity of the composite is attributed to the better coating and hence the isolation of the conductive particles from each other, thus hindering the formation of a conductive network "percolation." Overall, these results suggest that the control of the electrical properties of conductive composites could benefit from a good understanding and adequate control of the dynamics of the mixing process and the resulting degree of mixedness of the conductive particles in the polymer matrix.},

Improving the mechanical properties and the understanding of the anisotropic behavior of 3D printed parts are some of the main challenges of Additive Manufacturing. The aim of this work is to study the effect of printing speed on the orthotropic behavior of polylactic acid (PLA) manufactured by Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), also known as material extrusion (ME). 80 tensile tests were made on samples printed with printing speeds from 40 to 145 mm/s, and print directions were longitudinal and transverse. A new numerical method based on a trial of finite element simulations is proposed to find the Poisson's ratios of the orthotropic PLA manufactured by FDM. The mesh was made with Gmsh® and processing with Calculix®. The PLA was simulated as an elastic orthotropic material. Experimental measurements and numerical analysis show that the Poisson’s ratio perpendicular to the load decreases lightly with the printing speed and changes strongly with the print direction. The new numerical method proposed describes exactly the mechanical behavior of 3D printed parts manufactured by FDM with a longitudinal concentric fill partner, therefore the elastic behavior of 3D printed parts of PLA manufactured by FDM can be simulated as Elastic Orthotropic Material.},

While many recent review papers have discussed various algorithms for image reconstruction or acquisition systems, none of them has considered state-of-the-art hardware implementations of the associated image reconstruction algorithms to achieve real-time performance, especially for 3D ET where the computation requirement is excessively high. A 3D ET is useful in various applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and process control, but it is computationally very expensive with respect to its 2D counterpart. Most implementations are based on single or multi-core CPUs and, to a lesser extent, on either graphics processing units (GPUs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). However, there is a clear gap between the currently available processors, whose computation power exceeds hundreds of teraflops per second (TOPS) at a reasonable low power consumption, and the ones recently used in ET systems. This gives great potential for next-generation ET systems to achieve real-time 2D and 3D ET reconstruction within a small form factor. The paper summarizes the most recent ET hardware systems with respect to their performance in terms of quality and processing frame rate, reconstruction methods, along with optimization and future directions.},

Any improvement in this area of technology would be of great importance to industry, the economy, and the environment, as the global need for electrical energy and its efficient transfer and conversion rapidly increases. Carbon nanotube fibers, which are assemblies made purely of carbon nanotubes, can uniquely be used in macroscopic electrical applications including electrical wires and devices where the operation is enabled by these conductors. This paper presents details of the working prototype of an electrical machine, a transformer, where conventional copper wires have been replaced with conducting wires made purely of carbon nanotube fibers. It is demonstrated for the first time that macroscopic electrical wires made purely of carbon nanotubes (CNT) may successfully replace conventional copper wires in one of the most widely applied electrical machines, that is, an electrical transformer. It is shown that the transformer with CNT winding allows the conversion of electrical signals in wide range of frequencies. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

The range of interest frequency in this study is up to 10 MHz which is considered conventional high-frequency power converters operating range. AC resistance of both CNT yarn and copper (Cu) wires are measured by impedance analyzer for the small-signal frequency-response. The 1-turn core-less layout of inductors made of both CNT yarn and Cu wire are implemented to eliminate the proximity effect and magnetic core. The measurement results are compared with the theoretical model results based on Bessel-Kelvin function. The results show that the increasing rate of AC resistance in CNT yarn is lower than in Cu wire as frequency increases so that it causes lower CNT yarn resistance at higher frequencies. It was found that the Cu wire measurement result follows the theoretical model whereas CNT yarn does not. Therefore, a new skin effect related AC resistance correction factor for CNT yarn is introduced. To verify the same trends in large signal level of current, conduction losses for both CNT yarn and Cu wire are tested as an inductor component in a power converter circuit working like a large signal generator. The losses were collected and presented for the same frequency range (between 1 and 10 MHz). The results show less losses with CNT yarn inductor. Finally, another CNT yarn-based inductor was constructed and tested in around 200 W power converter circuit. The results show 91.72% of high efficiency at 3.125 MHz switching frequency. The study shows that, for power converter circuits working in the range higher than 1 MHz, the CNT yarns are reasonable to replace Cu wires due to the lower skin effect- related losses.},

The impedance measurements were carried out as a function of the frequency over range of 10-2 and 107 Hz at various temperatures between 300 K and 420 K. Bode and Nyquist plots of real and imaginary parts of complex impedance (Z*) were obtained and Cole–Cole approach was used to interpret the impedance characteristics. The results indicated that the bulk resistance of the material decreases significantly as the temperature increases. The frequency-dependent AC conductivities were calculated using the complex impedance data and dimensions of specimen. It has been observed that the alternating current values are compatible with the Jonscher’s power law. The behavior of dielectric constant and loss factor at the various temperatures were analyzed as a function of applied frequency. While the sample exhibited high dielectric permittivity in the low frequency region with the Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars (MWS) effect, it was observed that the permittivity decreased as a result of the dipoles' inability to rotate themselves in the field direction at high frequencies. No dielectric relaxation peak was observed in the loss spectra in our limits. From the results, it can be said that the contribution to the dielectric relaxation is due to the interface polarization and DC conductivity. Electric modulus formalism was also used to describe the conductivity and dielectric relaxation processes of SWCNT/VE binary composite. It was found that the obtained peak maximums shifted to higher frequencies as the temperature increased. It is concluded that the frequency regime below the peak maximum defines the range of mobile charge carriers, and in the regime above the maximum, the charge carriers are limited to short distance potential wells.},

This paper proposes a general transmission-line (TL) model for describing the propagation of electric signals along MWCNTs at microwave through terahertz frequencies that takes into account all these aspects. The dependence of the number of conducting channels of the single shell on the shell chirality and radius is described in the framework of the quasi-classical transport theory. The description of the intershell tunneling effects on the longitudinal transport of the π-electrons is carried on the basis of the density matrix formalism and Liouvilles equation. The electromagnetic coupling between the shells and ground plane is described in the frame of the classical TL theory. The intershell tunneling qualitatively changes the form of the TL equations through the tunneling inductance and capacitance operators, which have to be added, respectively, in series to the (kinetic and magnetic) inductance matrix and in parallel to the (quantum and electrical) capacitance matrix. For carbon nanotube (CNT) lengths greater than 500nm, the norm of the tunneling inductance operator is greater than 60 of the norm of the total inductance in the frequency range from gigahertz to terahertz. The tunneling inductance is responsible for a considerable coupling between the shells and gives rise to strong spatial dispersion. The model has been used to analyze the eigenmodes of a double-wall CNT above a ground plane. The intershell tunneling gives arise to strong anomalous dispersion in antisymmetrical modes. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose a model for the signal propagation along single wall CNTs (SWCNTs) of arbitrary chirality, at microwave through terahertz frequencies, which takes into account both these characteristics in a self-consistent way. We first study an SWCNT, disregarding the wall curvature, in the frame of a semiclassical treatment based on the Boltzmann equation in the momentum-independent relaxation time approximation. It allows expressing the longitudinal dynamic conductivity in terms of the number of effective conducting channels. Next, we study the behavior of this number as the nanotube radius varies and its relation with the kinetic inductance and quantum capacitance. Furthermore, we show that the effects of the spatial dispersion are negligible in the collision dominated regimes, whereas they may be important in the collisionless regimes, giving rise to sound waves propagating with the Fermi velocity. Then, we study the effects on the electron transport of the terahertz quantum transition induced by the wall curvature by using a quantum kinetic approach. The nanotube curvature modifies the kinetic inductance and gives arise to an additional RLC branch in the equivalent circuit, related to the terahertz quantum transition. The proposed model can be used effectively for analyzing the signal propagation in complex structures composed of SWCNTs with different chirality, such as bundles of SWCNTs and multiwall CNTs, providing that the tunneling between adjacent shells may be disregarded. © 2010 IEEE.},

Data were obtained for vulcanizates with a number of carbon blacks, varying in particle size and in structure. The influence of the degree of loading as well as of the type of elastomer was investigated. In a gum vulcanizate there is initially a decline in rate of stress relaxation at increasing elongation as a result of the limited extensibility of the elastomer chains, followed by a constant rate at higher extensions. The level for a carbon-loaded vulcanizate is always higher than for the gum. At lower elongations this is due to an additional relaxation mechanism, the reformation of broken weak bonds between elastomer and filler particles upon standing. At medium and higher elongations, the stress relaxation rate for the carbon-filled vuleanizates increases sharply with increasing extension, due to persistent carbon chain alignment and, at still higher elongation, to rupture of carbon-elastomer bonds, both phenomena leading to additional modes of stress relaxation. Resistivity relaxation rates reflect changes in carbon black distribution. An initial increase at small extensions is due to rebuilding of destroyed transient structures. A decrease in relaxation rates for medium extension ranges is caused by persistent carbon chain alignment, less pronounced at increasing elongation. At the higher elongations carbon-elastomer bonds arc broken, leading to randomization of chains, resulting in negative relaxation rates with higher structure blacks at the highest elongations. All such effects depend to a large extent on the carbon structures. The influence of loading level, of particle size and of elastomer type is discussed.},

The validation of the ANN highlights the feasibility as well as the current limits concerning the quantitative accuracy of mapping ETDR signals to strain profiles.},

In this context, a novel carbon fiber strain sensor is developed. The unique feature of the sensor is a fiber-break resistive measurement principle. The proposed strain sensor is based on characteristic impedance measurements of a two-core electrical transmission path, whereby at least one conductor consists of aligned carbon fibers fragments. The electrical time domain reflectometry (ETDR) was used in order to realize a spatial resolved strain measurement. In this contribution, the spatial resolution capability of the sensor was experimentally investigated in a cantilever arm test device. Furthermore, a Finite difference time domain (FDTD) model was established in order to simulate the ETDR signals. Special emphasis was on the identification of the relation in between electrical and mechanical behavior of the sensor. As a result, a spatial resolution in the low single-digits mm-range for engineering relevant strains was experimentally identified. The established FDTD model delivers results that are in good agreement with the experiments and thus constitutes the basis for a more comprehensive numerical-assisted characterization of the sensor.},

The phenomenological effects are investigated by a combined electrical, mechanical and optical analysis.

	abstract     = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) individually exhibit exceptional physical properties, surpassing state-of-the-art bulk materials, but are used commercially primarily as additives rather than as a standalone macroscopic product. This limited use of bulk CNT materials results from the inability to harness the superb nanoscale properties of individual CNTs into macroscopic materials. CNT alignment within a textile has been proven as a critical contributor to narrow this gap. Here, we report the development of an altered direct CNT spinning method based on the floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition process, which directly interacts with the self-assembly of the CNT bundles in the gas phase. The setup is designed to apply an AC electric field to continuously align the CNTs in situ during the formation of CNT bundles and subsequent aerogel. A mesoscale CNT model developed to simulate the alignment process has shed light on the need to employ AC rather than DC fields based on a CNT stiffening effect (z-pinch) induced by a Lorentz force. The AC-aligned synthesis enables a means to control CNT bundle diameters, which broadened from 16 to 25 nm. The resulting bulk CNT textiles demonstrated an increase in the specific electrical and tensile properties (up to 90 and 460%, respectively) without modifying the quantity or quality of the CNTs, as verified by thermogravimetric analysis and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. The enhanced properties were correlated to the degree of CNT alignment within the textile as quantified by small-angle X-ray scattering and scanning electron microscopy image analysis. Clear alignment (orientational order parameter = 0.5) was achieved relative to the pristine material (orientational order parameter = 0.19) at applied field intensities in the range of 0.5-1 kV cm-1at a frequency of 13.56 MHz.},

Evaluation of activation energy (Ea) by Kissinger, Ozawa, FWO and Friedman methods showed that the presence of GO facilitates the curing reaction by reducing Ea about 30% which is due to the catalytic effect of hydroxyl groups presented on the surface of GO for epoxy ring opening. According to Friedman's plots, curing reaction remained autocatalytic for all of samples. The presence of GO increased the autocatalytic term of the reaction (n) from 0.26 to 0.32.

EIT has the potential to offer continuous medical monitoring while being noninvasive, radiation free, and low cost. Due to their ill-posedness, image reconstruction typically uses regularization, which implies a hyperparameter controlling the tradeoff between noise rejection and resolution or other accuracies. In order to compare reconstruction algorithms, it is common to choose hyperparameter values such that the reconstructed images have equal noise performance (NP), i.e., the amount of measurement noise reflected in the images. For EIT many methods have been suggested, but none work well when the data originate from different measurement setups, such as for different electrode positions or measurement patterns. To address this issue, we propose a new NP metric based on the average signal-To-noise ratio in the image domain. The approach is validated for EIT using simulation experiments on a human thorax model and measurements on a resistor phantom. Results show that the approach is robust to the measurement configuration (i.e., number and position of electrodes, skip pattern) and the reconstruction algorithm used. We propose this novel approach as a way to select optimized measurement configurations and algorithms.},

	abstract     = {Although humans have been exposed to airborne nanosized particles (NSPs; < 100 nm) throughout their evolutionary stages, such exposure has increased dramatically over the last century due to anthropogenic sources. The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology is likely to become yet another source through inhalation, ingestion, skin uptake, and injection of engineered nanomaterials. Information about safety and potential hazards is urgently needed. Results of older biokinetic studies with NSPs and newer epidemiologic and toxicologic studies with airborne ultrafine particles can be viewed as the basis for the expanding field of nanotoxicology, which can be defined as safety evaluation of engineered nanostructures and nanodevices. Collectively, some emerging concepts of nanotoxicology can be identified from the results of these studies. When inhaled, specific sizes of NSPs are efficiently deposited by diffusional mechanisms in all regions of the respiratory tract. The small size facilitates uptake into cells and transcytosis across epithelial and endothelial cells into the blood and lymph circulation to reach potentially sensitive target sites such as bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen, and heart. Access to the central nervous system and ganglia via translocation along axons and dendrites of neurons has also been observed. NSPs penetrating the skin distribute via uptake into lymphatic channels. Endocytosis and biokinetics are largely dependent on NSP surface chemistry (coating) and in vivo surface modifications. The greater surface area per mass compared with larger-sized particles of the same chemistry renders NSPs more active biologically. This activity includes a potential for inflammatory and pro-oxidant, but also antioxidant, activity, which can explain early findings showing mixed results in terms of toxicity of NSPs to environmentally relevant species. Evidence of mitochondrial distribution and oxidative stress response after NSP endocytosis points to a need for basic research on their interactions with subcellular structures. Additional considerations for assessing safety of engineered NSPs include careful selections of appropriate and relevant doses/concentrations, the likelihood of increased effects in a compromised organism, and also the benefits of possible desirable effects. An interdisciplinary team approach (e.g., toxicology, materials science, medicine, molecular biology, and bioinformatics, to name a few) is mandatory for nanotoxicology research to arrive at an appropriate risk assessment.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether an ultrafine particle exerted its effects through transition metals or other soluble factors released from the surface of the particles. Methods - Both in vitro and in vivo models were used to test the imflammogenicity of carbon black (CB) and ultrafine carbon black (UfCB) and the role of transition metals was investigated by treating the particles with desferrioxamine mesylate (desferal), a transition metal chelator. Rats were instilled with particles and the cell population assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Calcium homeostasis in macrophages was assessed with a fluorimetric technique. Results - UfCB was inflammogenic compared with CB when instilled into Wistar rat lungs, an effect which could not be ameliorated by desferal treatment of the particles. Particle leachates produced no significant inflammation in vivo. In vitro experiments showed that the cytosolic calcium ion concentration in Mono Mac 6 cells was increased significantly after UfCB treatment and treatment of particles with desferal did not alter these effects. Particle leachates had no effect on cytosolic calcium ion concentration. Iron was not detected in leachates of the particles with the desferal assay, however, ng/mg of particles were detectable in citrate leachates with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Conclusions - The increased inflammogenicity of UfCB compared with CB cannot be explained by soluble transition metals released from or by accumulation of iron at the particle surface. Differences may be accounted for by increased surface area or particle number.},

UfCB generated a 50% neutrophil alveolitis 6 h after intratracheal instillation compared to CB, which showed similar activity to the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) vehicle control. UfCB instillation also produced a marked increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in BAL fluid, which was associated with increased epithelial permeability measured as total protein. In contrast, CB had much less of an effect in increasing BAL protein. Although both particle types caused a decrease in glutathione (GSH) in lung tissue compared to control, the greatest depletion was seen in ufCB-treated animals. To investigate time response, bronchoalveolar lavage was carried out at 6 h, 24 h, and 7 days after a single 125-μg instillation of ufCB.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production by BAL leukocytes increased gradually post-instillation, whereas NO production became significantly higher at 24 h after instillation and remained at raised levels up to 7 days. Higher doses of CB caused more inflammation than the ufCB. Thus, in the instillation model, a localized dose of particle over a certain level causes the particle mass to dominate the response, rather than the surface area. In contrast to the effect of CB, which showed a dose-related increasing inflammatory response, ufCB at the highest dose caused less of a neutrophil influx than at the lower dose. Six hours after intratracheal instillation, the threshold dose for neutrophil influx occurred at 50 μg. Calculation of surface area of particles instilled suggested that this was likely to be an overload-inducing dose of particles, as gauged from recent experiments with inhaled particles. In summary, this study provides evidence in a rat instillation model that ufCB has greater ability than CB to produce lung inflammation and oxidant stress at a relatively low dose of 125 μg. At high doses, however, BAL is not a reliable indicator of pulmonary response, since the overall response seems to scale to mass or volume of instilled particulate without an influence of surface area.},

	abstract     = {Nanotechnology is involved with the creation and/or manipulation of materials at the nanometer (nm) scale, and has arisen as a consequence of the novel properties that materials exhibit within the "nano" size range. The attraction of producing, and exploiting nanparticles (NPs; one dimension less than 100 nm) is a consequence of the fact that the properties are often strikingly different from bulk forms composed from the same material. As a consequence, the field of nanotechnology has generated substantial interest resulting in incorporation of NPs into a wide variety of products including electronics, food, clothing, medicines, cosmetics and sporting equipment. While there is general recognition that nanotechnology has the potential to advance science, quality of life and to generate substantial financial gains, a number of reports suggest that potential toxicity should be considered in order to allow the safe and sustainable development of such products. For example, substances which are ordinarily innocuous can elicit toxicity due to the altered chemical and physical properties that become evident within nano dimensions leading to potentially detrimental consequences for the producer, consumer or environment. Research into respirable air pollution particles (PM10) has focused on the role of ultrafine particle (diameter less than 100 nm) in inducing oxidative stress leading to inflammation and resulting in exacerbation of preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Epidemiological studies have repeatedly found a positive correlation between the level of particulate air pollution and increased morbidity and mortality rates in both adults and children. Such studies have also identified a link between respiratory ill health and the number of ambient ultrafine particles. In vivo and in vitro toxicology studies confirm that for low solubility, low toxicity materials such as TiO2, carbon black and polystyrene beads, ultrafine particles are more toxic and inflammogenic than fine particles. In many of these studies the term "ultrafine particle" can be directly exchanged for nanoparticle, as these particles are manufactured industrially. In such studies the NPs generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to a greater extent than larger particles leading to increased transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators via intracellular signaling pathways including calcium and oxidative stress. To date, only limited NP compositions and structures have been tested, including materials such as carbon, polystyrene beads and TiO2 as surrogate particles that aimed to represent particulate air pollution. All of these materials are generally low toxicity and low solubility. Much work is required to identify whether the conclusions made for such materials can be extrapolated to engineered nanoparticles varying not only in size but also, shape, composition, structure, surface area, surface coating, and aggregation state. Therefore, it is necessary to reveal if the diversity of NPs available will confer to a varied extent and mechanisms of toxicity. © 2006 IEEE.},

	abstract     = {Objective. Implantable neuromodulation devices that have cuff electrodes are known to exert mechanical pressure on the target nerves. The amount of pressure exerted by cuff enclosures is one of the key determinants of physiological safety of these devices since excess pressures can cause neural damage. Because direct measurements of pressure on a nerve are challenging, the current cuff design approaches rely heavily on theoretical models or numerical computations for pressure predictions. An experimental approach to test these devices for pressure can complement existing theoretical models and can also serve as a quality control step to screen cuff electrode designs before implantation. Approach. We hypothesize that the pressure exerted on a nerve by a cuff can be estimated by measuring the resulting changes to the nerve's electrical impedance. Main results. We investigated ten 1 cm-long explanted rat sciatic nerves: five that were used within an hour after surgery, and five after 50 h of storage in physiological saline. For each experiment we applied variable pressure on the nerve ex vivo and measured the resulting changes in its impedance. We found a strong correlation between the external pressure on the nerve and its impedance and generated a pressure-impedance calibration curve. At the upper limit of physiologically safe pressure, the nerve impedance increased by ∼2 kΩ, whereas, a rise of ∼3 kΩ corresponded to pressure value that onsets irreversible nerve damage. Significance. As a proof-of-concept, we used this protocol to generate a pressure-impedance calibration curve for a monkey tibial nerve and estimated pressure exerted by a commercial silicone cuff electrode on the explanted nerve. This single-point measurement was in an agreement with an independent estimate of the pressure measured using a mechanical pull test within 3 mmHg.},

The proposed sensing methodology comprised of two parts. First, a passive thin film was designed such that its electrical permittivity increases in tandem with applied tensile loading and decreases while unloading. It was found that patterning the thin films could enhance their dielectric property’s sensitivity to strain. The film can be deposited onto prosthesis surfaces as an external coating prior to implant. Second, an electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) measurement technique and reconstruction algorithm were implemented to capture strain-induced changes in the dielectric property of nanocomposite-coated prosthesis phantoms when subjected to different loading scenarios. The preliminary results showed that ECT, when coupled with strain-sensitive nanocomposites, could quantify the strain-induced changes in the dielectric property of thin film-coated prosthesis phantoms. The results suggested that ECT coupled with embedded thin films could serve as a new noncontact strain sensing method for scenarios when tethered strain sensors cannot be used or instrumented, especially in the case of osseointegrated prostheses.},

Revision surgeries cost the healthcare system over $8 billion annually in the United States. Despite the prevalence of aseptic loosening, timely and accurate detection remains a challenge because traditional imaging modalities, such as plain radiographs, struggle to reliably detect the early stages of implant loosening. Motivated by this challenge, we present a novel approach for in vivo monitoring and failure detection of cemented joint replacements. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement is modified with low volume fractions of chopped carbon fiber (CF) to impart piezoresistive-based self-sensing. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is then used to detect and monitor load-induced deformation and fracture of CF/PMMA in a phantom tank. We therefore show that EIT indeed is able to detect loading force on a prosthetic surrogate, distinguish between increasing load magnitudes, detect failure of implant fixation, and even distinguish between cement cracking and cement de-bonding without direct contact to the surrogate. Because EIT is a low-cost, physiologically benign, and potentially real-time imaging modality, the feasibility study herein presented could positively impact orthopedic researchers by providing, via in vivo monitoring, insight into the factors that initiate aseptic loosening.},

The pve-MTM predicts the ion concentration distribution cmod (t) by coupling the poroviscoelastic and mass transport model to describe the hydrodynamics, rheology, and transport phenomena inside SAT. The w-EIT measures the time-difference conductivity distribution Δγ (t) in SAT resulted from the ion transport. Based on the integration, the two viscoelastic properties which are viscoelastic shear modulus of SAT Gv and relaxation time of SAT τv are estimated by applying an iterative curve-fitting between the normalized average ion concentration distribution 〈ĉmod〉 (t) predicted from pve-MTM and the experimental normalized average ion concentration distribution 〈ĉexp 〉(t) derived from w-EIT. The in-vivo experiments were conducted by applying external compressive pressure P on human calf boundary to induce interstitial fluid flow and ion movement in SAT. As a result, the value of Gv was range from 4.9-6.3 kPa and the value of τv was range from 27.50-38.5 s with the value of average goodness-of-fit curve fitting R 2 > 0.76. These values of Gv and τv were compared to the human and animal tissue from the literature in order to verify this method. The results from pve-MTM provide evidence that Gvv and τv play a role in the predicted value of ĉmod.},

	abstract     = {An algorithm for objectively calculating the hyperparameter for linearized one-step electrical impedance tomography (EIT) image reconstruction algorithms is proposed and compared to existing strategies. EIT is an ill-conditioned problem in which regularization is used to calculate a stable and accurate solution by incorporating some form of prior knowledge into the solution. A hyperparameter is used to control the trade-off between conformance to data and conformance to the prior. A remaining challenge is to develop and validate methods of objectively selecting the hyperparameter. In this paper, we evaluate and compare five different strategies for hyperparameter selection. We propose a calibration-based method of objective hyperparameter selection, called BestRes, that leads to repeatable and stable image reconstructions that are indistinguishable from heuristic selections. Results indicate: (1) heuristic selections of hyperparameter are inconsistent among experts, (2) generalized cross-validation approaches produce under-regularized solutions, (3) L-curve approaches are unreliable for EIT and (4) BestRes produces good solutions comparable to expert selections. Additionally, we show that it is possible to reliably detect an inverse crime based on analysis of these parameters. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In this review, silicone properties are discussed along with several biomedical applications, including medical inserts, speciality contact lenses, drains and shunts, urinary catheters, reconstructive gel fillers, craniofacial prosthesis, nerve conduits, and metatarsophalangeal joint implants. Silicones are prone to microbial infections when exposed and interactions with the host tissue. As in the case of medical inserts, the development of specific antimicrobial strategies is essential. The review highlights silicone implants' interaction with soft and bone tissue and various antimicrobial strategies, including surface coating, physical or chemical modifications, treating with antibiotics or plasma-activated surfaces to develop the resistance to bacterial infection.

Piezoresistivity in particular is achieved by the creation of a deformation-sensitive electrical conductor network and is the underlying effect of most structural health and motion sensing. The polymer matrix, however, introduces time-dependent mechanical behavior known as viscoelasticity. Viscoelasticity affects the relationship between relative resistance change and mechanical strain over time and becomes particularly important over long times, as well as at high temperatures, radiation aging, and in the presence of high mechanical stresses. The characterization of these influences on the piezoresistivity is therefore crucial to maintain sensor stability under harsh conditions. While experimental studies have been conducted, the effect of viscoelasticity has not been thorougly analyzed. Here we study resistance relaxation and hysteresis in carbon nanotube nanocomposites under the influence of matrix viscoelasticity. First we characterize the multiaxial viscoelastic behavior directly without invoking the common assumption of constant Poisson’s ratio, which is central to predicting resistnace relaxation and hysteresis. We then apply the viscoelastic master curve to a micromechanics-based numerical piezoresistive model and study the relative resistance change under relaxation, creep, and deformation-controlled cyclic loading. The results are compared to the common assumptions of constant Poisson’s ratio and constant bulk modulus. We show that the time-dependent transverse deformation leads to network compaction and is the mechanism behind resistance relaxation and hysteresis.},

In quest of developing and adoption of strategies to reduce bruise damage, it is of utmost importance to understand major factors influencing bruise susceptibility of fresh produce at these stages. This review presents a critical discussion of factors affecting bruising during harvest and postharvest handling of fresh fruits. Excessive compression forces during harvesting by handpicking or machines, and a series of impacts during harvesting, transport and packhouse operations can cause severe bruise damage. The review has further revealed that bruising is dependent on a number of other factors such as produce maturity, ripening, harvest time (during the day or season) and time lapse after harvest. The susceptibility to bruising is partly dependent on how these factors alter the produce physiological and biochemical properties, and the environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity and several other postharvest treatments. Hence, the successful applications of harvesting techniques by use of trained personnel and proper harvesting equipment are essential to reduce both the incidence and severity of bruising. Furthermore, the careful selection of postharvest handling temperature and other treatments can increase resistance of fresh produce to bruise damage.},

After 48 h, impacted fruit were determined and analyzed for bruise area (BA), bruise volume (BV), browning index (BI), total color difference (∆E), image analysis for bruise area (BAI), and fractal dimension (FD) at the bruising region on peeled guava. Results showed that the correlation coefficient (r = −0.6055) between ∆E and FD value was higher than ∆E and either BA (r = 0.3132) or BV (r = 0.2095). The FD variable was determined as a better indicator than conventional measurement (BA or BV) for pulp browning and impact bruising susceptibility. The FD variable also exhibited highest R2adj value (81.69%) among the other five variables, as the highest precision model with high determination coefficient value (R2adj) (&gt;0.8) for impact bruising prediction. Recommended condition of the FD variable to minimize impact bruising was drop height of 0.53 m for five drops under storage at 30 °C.

For most fruit types, bruising is the most common type of postharvest mechanical injury, other types of mechanical damage being abrasions and open injuries (e.g., punctures). Not only a direct effect of fruit bruising affecting the quality appreciation by the consumer exists, but bruises, even small ones, can open the way for pathogen attack (Van Zeebroeck et al., 2006). By understanding the fruit susceptibility to bruising it is possible to identify when to adopt techniques which will reduce the chances of sustaining high levels of damage, or identify cultivars that require additional care when handling (Bollen, 2005). Baritelle and Hyde (2001) suggested that reducing relative turgor through slight dehydration can reduce tissue elastic modulus, which can in turn make the fruit more “self-cushioning,” by distributing a given force over a larger area of the fruit’s curved surface. This distribution effect also occurs in padding materials for reducing the aggressiveness of packing-line machinery (see Mechanical Impacts at Harvest and After Harvest Technologies). The result is reduced impact-induced stress, and thereby reduced probability of bruise occurrence. For most fruits, bruise susceptibility increases with maturity. This is partly responsible for the early-harvesting typical of our days often criticized by many consumers. Consumers argue that nowadays a fruit is not as tasty as it was some decades ago, when it was harvested later in the season. But this is a side effect of our days, when fruits have to travel long distances from the production to the consumption centers.}

By customising the conductivity and elastic modulus of the composite, the material can easily be adapted for many human physiological sensing applications. For applications such weight distribution sensors for wheelchair users, it is desirable to have not just a single sensor reading but instead a 2D map of pressure or strain. In this work, after demonstrating that the material can be modelled to give estimated strain value, we have developed a system to give a 2D map of pressure applied to the sensor using Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). This method has the advantage that a 2D pressure map can be obtained from a sensor using a homogeneous cast sheet of composite with electrodes around the perimeter only, without requiring complex patterning or a sensor array. Although the design is scalable, our demonstration system was fabricated using a 100 mm diameter pressure pad of carbon black (CB) silicone composite with electrodes evenly spaced around its perimeter. A low-cost circuit was developed to apply current to the material and measure the voltage between electrodes. The voltage measurements were then reconstructed into maps of resistivity and indications of compressive stress. Testing demonstrates that the fabricated pressure sensor can sense localised pressure within the pressure pad. The positional accuracy of the sensor was found to be on average 3.6 mm for the 100 mm diameter circular domain under test.},

In contrast to conventional cochlear electrode arrays manufactured by manual processes that consist of electrode-wire welding, the placement of each electrode, and silicone molding over wired structures, the proposed cochlear electrode array is manufactured by semi-automated laser micro-structuring and a mass-produced layer-by-layer silicone deposition scheme similar to the semiconductor fabrication process. (2) Methods: The proposed 32-channel electrode array has 32 electrode contacts with a length of 24 mm and 0.75 mm spacing between contacts. The width of the electrode array is 0.45 mm at its apex and 0.8 mm at its base, and it has a three-layered arrangement consisting of a 32-channel electrode layer and two 16-lead wire layers. To assess its feasibility, we conducted an electrochemical evaluation, stiffness measurements, and insertion force measurements. (3) Results: The electrochemical impedance and charge storage capacity are 3.11 ± 0.89 kOhm at 1 kHz and 5.09 mC/cm2, respectively. The V/H ratio, which indicates how large the vertical stiffness is compared to the horizontal stiffness, is 1.26. The insertion force is 17.4 mN at 8 mm from the round window, and the maximum extraction force is 61.4 mN. (4) Conclusions: The results of the preliminary feasibility assessment of the proposed 32-channel cochlear electrode array are presented. After further assessments are performed, a 32-channel cochlear implant system consisting of the proposed 32-channel electrode array, 32-channel neural stimulation and recording IC, titanium-based hermetic package, and sound processor with wireless power and signal transmission coil will be completed.},

Methods: A retrospective file review of 308 consecutive adult implantations in 269 patients between 1994 and 2010 at Odense University Hospital was performed. Results: The three most common major complications were wound infection (1.6%), permanent chorda tympani syndrome (1.6%) and electrode migration/misplacement/accidental removal (1.3%). Permanent facial nerve paresis occurred following one implantation (0.3%). Transient chorda tympani syndrome (30.8%), vertigo/dizziness (29.5%) and tinnitus (4.9%) were the most frequent minor complications. © Informa Healthcare.},

	abstract     = {Composite materials, by nature, are universally dielectric. The distribution of the phases, including voids and cracks, has a major influence on the dielectric properties of the composite materials. The dielectric relaxation behavior measured by Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy (BbDS) is often caused by interfacial polarization, which is known as Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars polarization that develops because of the heterogeneity of the composite materials. A prominent mechanism in the low frequency range is driven by charge accumulation at the interphases between different constituent phases. In our previous work, we observed in-situ changes in dielectric behavior during static tensile testing, and also studied the effects of applied mechanical and ambient environments on composite material damage states based on the evaluation of dielectric spectral analysis parameters. In the present work, a two dimensional conformal computational model was developed using a COMSOL™ multi-physics module to interpret the effective dielectric behavior of the resulting composite as a function of applied frequency spectra, especially the effects of volume fraction, the distribution of the defects inside of the material volume, and the influence of the permittivity and Ohmic conductivity of the host materials and defects.},

It is established that the electrical and dielectric properties of the studied systems significantly depend on the nanofiller content. It is found that electrical conductivity and dielectric constant exhibit percolation behavior when the filler's content increases. In this case, the electrical conductivity increases exponentially, indicating the formation of filler electrically conductive mesh inside the polymer matrix. A small jump in electrical conductivity when reaching the percolation threshold indicates the formation of indirect contacts between the particles. The value of the percolation threshold of conductivity is 8%. It is shown that the dielectric constant of epoxy nanosystems is almost unchanged in the frequency range of 102-105 Hz. It is related to the structural features of the filler particles, which ensure the existence of a minimal dielectric gradient between the matrix and the filler. It is found that the dielectric constant of the studied systems also shows percolation behavior. The obtained material based on the epoxy matrix is characterized by a high value of dielectric constant, which at a carbon black nanopowder content of 29% is 4680. This material is characterized by relative frequency invariance and a high value of dielectric constant, so it has great potential for practical application.}

The large dielectric constant of water at the relevant gigahertz frequencies can be used to form systems that mimic surface plasmon resonances that are typically reserved for nanoscale metallic objects. The absorptive properties of water furthermore act to homogenize higher-mode profiles and to preferentially select evanescent field concentrations such as the axial hotspot. Thus, beyond providing an explanation for a popular-science phenomenon, we outline a method to experimentally model subwavelength field patterns using thermal imaging in macroscopic dielectric systems.},

These changes have been examined both in materials that have no previous loading history and in test pieces that have been subjected to a specific known prestrain. When a previously unstrained, filled elastomer specimen is stretched to moderate extensions, the electrical resistivity increases. This is ascribed to the breakdown of the carbon black network structure. At higher tensile extensions, the resistivity decreases. This reduction in the electrical resistivity is attributed to the alignment of the shaped carbon black aggregates under strain. During unloading, the resistivity behavior is different from that during loading, with the final unloaded electrical resistivity being significantly higher than that measured in the unstrained elastomer. This dramatic change in the electrical properties after unloading is in marked contrast to the relatively modest changes observed in the mechanical behavior. After the first cycle, the electrical behavior becomes much more reversible, and this indicates that the bulk of the damage experienced by the carbon black network is developed during the first cycle. After unloading from a large strain, the electrical anisotropy is small, whereas the mechanical anisotropy is more marked. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We introduce Electrick, a low-cost and versatile sensing technique that enables touch input on a wide variety of objects and surfaces, whether small or large, flat or irregular. This is achieved by using electric field tomography in concert with an electrically conductive material, which can be easily and cheaply added to objects and surfaces. We show that our technique is compatible with commonplace manufacturing methods, such as spray/brush coating, vacuum forming, and casting/molding - enabling a wide range of possible uses and outputs. Our technique can also bring touch interactivity to rapidly fabricated objects, including those that are laser cut or 3D printed. Through a series of studies and illustrative example uses, we show that Electrick can enable new interactive opportunities on a diverse set of objects and surfaces that were previously static.},

	abstract     = {Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a promising application that displays changes in conductivity within a body. The basic principle of the method is the repeated measurement of surface voltages of a body, which are a result of rolling injection of known and small-volume sinusoidal AC current to the body through the electrodes attached to its surface. This method finds application in biomedicine, biology and geology. The objective of this paper is to present the applications of Electrical Impedance Tomography, along with the method’s capabilities and limitations due to the electrical properties of the human body. For this purpose, investigation of existing literature has been conducted, using electronic databases, PubMed, Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore. In addition, there was a secondary research phase, using paper citations found during the first research phase. It should be noted that Electrical Impedance Tomography finds use in a plethora of medical applications, as the different tissues of the body have different conductivities and dielectric constants. Main applications of EIT include imaging of lung function, diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, detection of tumors in the chest area and diagnosis and distinction of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. EIT advantages include portability, low cost and safety, which the method provide, since it is a noninvasive imaging method that does not cause damage to the body. The main disadvantage of the method, which blocks its wider spread, appears in the image composition from the voltage measurements, which are conducted by electrodes placed on the periphery of the body, because the injected currents are affected nonlinearly by the general distribution of the electrical properties of the body. Furthermore, the complex impedance of the skin-electrode interface can be modelled by using a capacitor and two resistor, as a result of skin properties. In conclusion, Electrical Impedance Tomography is a promising method for the development of noninvasive diagnostic medicine, since it is able to provide imaging of the interior of the human body in real time without causing harm or putting the human body in risk.},

EIT-NN learns a computationally efficient, nonlinear reconstruction attribute, achieving high-resolution tactile sensation and well-generalized reconstruction capability to address arbitrary complex touch modalities. We train EIT-NN by presenting a sim-to-real dataset synthesis strategy for computationally efficient generalizability. Furthermore, we propose a spatial sensitivity aware mean-squared error loss function, which uses an intrinsic spatial sensitivity of the sensor to guarantee a well-posed EIT operation. We validate an outperformance of EIT-NN against conventional EIT sensing methods by conducting a simulation study, a single-touch indentation test, and a two-point discrimination test. The results show improved spatial resolution, sensitivity, and localization accuracy. The beneficial features of the generalized sensing of EIT-NN were demonstrated by examining touch modality discrimination performance.},

A novel conductivity surface decomposition approach, based on low order bivariate polynomials and RBF networks is introduced for the efficient solution of the EIT inverse problem. Next, segmentation of the reconstructed images is performed using a convolutional neural network and transfer learning. Finally, a subspace KNN ensemble classifier is trained on the set of object descriptors extracted from the segmented inhomogeneities to classify the objects.

This approach brings disadvantages that jeopardize their applicability aspect and wide use. To address this limitation, the main thrust of this paper is to present a method for touch position identification for an electrical tomography flexible tactile sensor. This is done by using a supervised machine learning algorithm for performing classification, namely quadratic discriminant analysis. This approach provides accurate contact location identification, increasing the detection speed and the sensor versatility when compared with traditional electrical tomography approaches. Results obtained show classification accuracy rates of up to 91.6% on unseen test data and an average Euclidean error ranging from 1 to 10 mm depending on the contact location over the sensor. The sensor is then applied in real case scenarios to show its efficiency. These outcomes are encouraging since they promote the future practical usage of flexible and low-cost sensors.},

The new pressure distribution sensor consists of conductive elastic fabrics and layered polyurethane (PU) nanoweb containing air shells to increase its pressure sensitivity. The sensitivity and hysteresis of three fabric sensors with different layer structures were measured to compare their electromechanical properties as a pressure sensor. The sensor with one PU nanoweb layer sandwiched by two conductive elastic fabrics showed the best performance and was chosen for real-time pressure distribution imaging experiments. The imaging system acquired the electrical impedance data along the boundary of the sensor by injecting ac currents and measuring induced voltages on its boundary. This enabled the system to detect both piezo-resistance and piezo-capacitance changes in the sensing area of the sensor subject to a vertically applied pressure distribution on the top surface of the sensor. Applying an impedance image reconstruction algorithm to the collected boundary data, impedance images of the sensing area were reconstructed in real time, which corresponded to the applied pressure distribution. Quantitative analyses of reconstructed impedance images were performed to evaluate the overall performance of the developed multilayer fabric pressure distribution sensor. The fabric sensor and the imaging system provide a new way of quantitatively visualizing pressure distributions in real time.},

Artificial skins can help robots to have the same sense of touch, especially for their social interactions. This paper presents a pressure mapping sensing using piezo-resistive fabric to represent aspects of the sense of touch. In past few years’ electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is considered to be able offer a good alternative for artificial skin in particular for its ease of adaptation for large area skin compared to individual matrix based sensors. The EIT has also very good temporal performance in data collection allowing for monitoring of fast responses to touch stimulation, enabling a truly real time touch sensing. Electromechanical responses of a conductive fabric can be exploited using EIT to create a low cost and large area touch sensing. Such electromechanical properties are often very complex, so to improve the imaging resolution and touch visibility an artificial intelligent (AI) was used in addition to the state of the art spatio-temporal imaging algorithm. This work demonstrates a step towards an integrated seamless skin with large area sensing in dynamical settings, closer to natural human skin’s behaviour. For the first time a dynamical touch sensing are studies by means of a spatio-temporal based electrical impedance tomography (EIT) imaging on a conductive fabric. The experimental results demonstrated the successful results by a combined AI with dynamical EIT imaging results in single and multiple points of touch.},

Particularly, we tested our framework on the development of a piezoresistive insole-shaped sensor prototype. Our approach couples the implementation of the forward model through a physics-based general purpose FEM software and an ANN model for the inverse problem solution. First, we developed a FEM forward model in COMSOL Multyphysics, and we optimized the parameters of the model to better resemble the prototype characteristics. Then, we trained an ANN model with an &#x201C;artificial&#x201D; dataset generated by feeding the forward model with a large set of different conductivity distribution samples and measuring the voltage at the boundary electrodes. For comparison, we employed the forward model also to compute the sensitivity matrix, which is required to apply standard linear reconstruction methods. We statistically compared the performance of the proposed machine learning approach with those of standard linear reconstruction methods. The results on simulated data highlight the higher accuracy of the ANN with respect to the other methods. In particular, the mean conductivity RMSE is 0.8 S/m. Finally, we tested our approach with the physical prototype to evaluate the performance in touch position detection. Again, the ANN achieves the minimum mean position error (5.74 mm), demonstrating the feasibility of using machine learning trained with artificial datasets for solving the inverse problem in EIT-based tactile sensors.},

Mathematically, the EIT reconstruction problem is an ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem in which it is commonly assumed that electrodes are located only on the surface of the body. In a thin sensitive skin, however, electrodes can readily be located within the 2-D conducting domain. This paper compares existing electrode-drive patterns with new patterns in which a number of reference electrodes are located inside of the sensitive skin. Simulation results and experimental data show improvements in both resolution and robustness to noise of the reconstructed image. These improvements are shown to be consistent for several commonly used regularization methods. © 2011 IEEE.},

By applying EIT to conductive materials such as pressure sensitive conductive rubbers, a deformable and deformation sensitive tactile distribution sensor can be realized. In this paper, some of the basic characteristics of the EIT based tactile sensor are reported. Also, we have demostrated how the conductive rubber sheets can be used with EIT to form a stretch distribution tactile sensor which detects sophisticated stimulations such as rubbing and pinching. In the end, we will introduce our original conductive knit with high stretchability and low hysteresis, which can easily be implemented over complex 3D surfaces such as the face and also highly stretching areas such as the elbow joint. © 2008 IEEE.},

The sensor showed high repeatability and durability and operated normally after 1000 cycles at 360 kPa applied pressure. The sensor was made by coating polyurethane foam with silicone rubber and further dip-coated with MWCNT dispersed TPU ink. The use of TPU as a binding material helped MWCNT strongly attach to the foam skeleton and reduced the interfacial electrical resistance. As a result, low hysteresis (6.4%) was achieved. By controlling amount of silicone rubber impregnated, the sensitivity can be controlled from 0.013 kPa−1 to 0.032 kPa−1.

In this study, MRE composed of silicon rubber (SR) and 70 wt% of micron-sized carbonyl iron particles (CIP) was prepared and subjected to stress relaxation evaluation by torsional shear load. The microstructure and particle distribution of the obtained MRE was evaluated by a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The influence of constant low strain at 0.01% is the continuing concern within the linear viscoelastic (LVE) region of MRE. Stress relaxation plays a significant role in the life cycle of MRE and revealed that storage modulus was reduced by 8.7%, normal force has weakened by 27%, and stress performance was reduced by 6.88% along approximately 84,000&nbsp;s test duration time. This time scale was the longest ever reported being undertaken in the MRE stress relaxation study. Novel micro-mechanisms that responsible for the depleted performance of MRE was obtained by microstructurally observation using FESEM and in-phase mode of atomic force microscope (AFM). Attempts have been made to correlate strain localization produced by stress relaxation, with molecular deformation in MRE amorphous matrix. Exceptional attention was focused on the development of molecular slippage, disentanglement, microplasticity, microphase separation, and shear bands. The relation between these microstructural phenomena and the viscoelastic properties of MRE was diffusely defined and discussed. The presented MRE is homogeneous with uniform distribution of CIP. The most significant recent developments of systematic correlation between the effects of microstructural deformation and durability performance of MRE under stress relaxation has been observed and evaluated.},

The following chapter then analyzes the objective function of the EIT inverse problem together with Tikhonov regularization. Besides setting up the objective function with a regularizing member, the authors also specify the differentiation equation for the iterative solution of the inverse problem via the Gauss-Newton method. Further, the time consumption of computing the Jacobian via a CPU compared to using a newly assembled program that exploits GPU-based parallel processing is investigated in detail.

	abstract     = {Image reconstruction in soft-field tomography is based on an inverse problem formulation, where a forward model is fitted to the data. In medical applications, where the anatomy presents complex shapes, it is common to use finite element models (FEMs) to represent the volume of interest and solve a partial differential equation that models the physics of the system. Over the last decade, there has been a shifting interest from 2D modeling to 3D modeling, as the underlying physics of most problems are 3D. Although the increased computational power of modern computers allows working with much larger FEM models, the computational time required to reconstruct 3D images on a fine 3D FEM model can be significant, on the order of hours. For example, in electrical impedance tomography (EIT) applications using a dense 3D FEM mesh with half a million elements, a single reconstruction iteration takes approximately 15-20min with optimized routines running on a modern multi-core PC. It is desirable to accelerate image reconstruction to enable researchers to more easily and rapidly explore data and reconstruction parameters. Furthermore, providing high-speed reconstructions is essential for some promising clinical application of EIT. For 3D problems, 70% of the computing time is spent building the Jacobian matrix, and 25% of the time in forward solving. In this work, we focus on accelerating the Jacobian computation by using single and multiple GPUs. First, we discuss an optimized implementation on a modern multi-core PC architecture and show how computing time is bounded by the CPU-to-memory bandwidth; this factor limits the rate at which data can be fetched by the CPU. Gains associated with the use of multiple CPU cores areminimal, since data operands cannot be fetched fast enough to saturate the processing power of even a single CPU core. GPUs have much faster memory bandwidths compared to CPUs and better parallelism. We are able to obtain acceleration factors of 20times on a single NVIDIA S1070 GPU, and of 50times on four GPUs, bringing the Jacobian computing time for a fine 3D mesh from 12min to 14s. We regard this as an important step toward gaining interactive reconstruction times in 3D imaging, particularly when coupled in the future with acceleration of the forward problem. While we demonstrate results for EIT, these results apply to any soft-field imaging modality where the Jacobian matrix is computed with the adjoint method. © 2012 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

	abstract     = {OBJECTIVE The objective of this article is to explain ways in which electric current is conducted to and through the human body and how this influences the nature of injuries. METHODS This multidisciplinary topic is explained by first reviewing electrical and pathophysiological principles. There are discussions of how electric current is conducted through the body via air, water, earth, and man-made conductive materials. There are also discussions of skin resistance (impedance), internal body resistance, current path through the body, the let-go phenomenon, skin breakdown, electrical stimulation of skeletal muscles and nerves, cardiac dysrhythmias and arrest, and electric shock drowning. After the review of basic principles, a number of clinically relevant examples of accident mechanisms and their medical effects are discussed. Topics related to high-voltage burns include ground faults, ground potential gradient, step and touch potentials, arcs, and lightning. RESULTS The practicing physician will have a better understanding of electrical mechanisms of injury and their expected clinical effects. CONCLUSIONS There are a variety of types of electrical contact, each with important characteristics. Understanding how electric current reaches and travels through the body can help the clinician understand how and why specific accidents occur and what medical and surgical problems may be expected.},

We describe the key features of this software, followed by examples of its use. One general issue with inverse problem software is the difficulty of correctly implementing algorithms and the consequent ease with which subtle numerical bugs can be inadvertently introduced. EIDORS helps with this issue, by allowing sharing and reuse of well-documented and debugged software. On the other hand, since EIDORS is designed to facilitate use by non-specialists, its use may inadvertently result in such numerical errors. In order to address this issue, we develop a list of ways in which such errors with inverse problems (which we refer to as 'cheats') may occur.

Over past few decades, a number of impedance based noninvasive tissue characterization techniques such as bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), electrical impedance plethysmography (IPG), impedance cardiography (ICG), and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) have been proposed and a lot of research works have been conducted on these methods for noninvasive tissue characterization and disease diagnosis. In this paper BIA, EIS, IPG, ICG, and EIT techniques and their applications in different fields have been reviewed and technical perspective of these impedance methods has been presented.

This work characterizes an active mixing printhead used in conjunction with a 3D printing process known as Direct Ink Writing. Besides compositional control, a major benefit of this approach is that it offers a safe method for working with these materials, which can otherwise be hazardous once mixed. Custom fuel and oxidizer inks are fed at fixed volumetric rates into an active mixing printhead, and both the rotational speed of the mixing impeller as well as the fuel–oxidizer ratio are varied. Upon ignition, the propagation speed increases with the rotational speed of the mixer and plateaus above a critical value of ≈750 rpm. The critical mixing speed is corroborated by computational fluid simulations and an analytical expression that considers the inks’ complex fluid behavior. Additionally, varying the composition results in a wide range of propagation speeds with peak reactivity corresponding to a fuel-rich formulation (ϕ = 1.5). A test article incorporating a fast- and slow-burning region demonstrates how spatial composition can manipulate the reactivity.},

CB-PDMS specimens have been fabricated with 7.5 and 10 weight percentage (w.t.%) of CB and subjected to repeated stretching while continually monitoring resistance and stress. A model for the resistive relaxation in time has been developed using 30 relaxations to give maximum coefficients of variance of the constants of 18.54% and 52.72% for 7.5 and 10 w.t.% of CB. The ability to model resistance relaxation is useful for the development of, accurate, highly flexible dynamic strain sensors.},

Dispersion in the aqueous phase has been both a critical impediment to and a prerequisite for particle studies. Carbon black has been used as a surrogate to investigate the biological effects of carbonaceous particles. Here, biocompatible methods were established to disperse carbon black into ultrafine and fine particles which are generally distinguished by the small size of 100 nm. Carbon black with a distinct particle size, N330 and N990 were suspended in blood plasma, cell culture media, Krebs-Ringer's solution (KR), or physiological salt solution (PSS). Large clumps were observed in all dispersion preparations; however, sonication improved dispersion - averaged particle sizes for N330 and N990 were 85.0 ± 42.9 and 112.4 ± 67.9 nm, respectively, in plasma; the corresponding sizes in culture media were 84.8 ± 38.4 and 164.1 ± 77.8 nm. However, sonication was not enough to disperse N330 less than 100 nm in either KR or PSS. Application of Tween 80 along with sonication reduced the size of N330 to less than 100 nm, and dispersed N990 larger than 100 nm (73.6 ± 28.8 and 80.1 ± 30.0 nm for N330 and 349.5 ± 161.8 and 399.8 ± 181.1 nm for N990 in KR and PSS, respectively). In contrast, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) exhibited little effect. Electron microscopy confirmed the typical aciniform structure of the carbon arrays; however, zeta potential measurement failed to explain the dispersibility of carbon black.

Tumor growth was evaluated by histological findings and analysis of the logistic curves (growth curve) determining the stabilized initial size of tumors (10cm3) corresponding to the synchronization of cultured cells. The histology of benzo (a) pyrene (BP)-stimulated tumor cells showed fibrosarcoma cells with abundant progressive pleomorphism and atypical cells in the control rats, and fibroblastic tumor cells with histiocytic and apoptotic cells with loss of pleomorphic and atypical cells in both e--ion and e+-ion and HVE groups. The logistic curves (growth curve) of tumor growth were represented by Hill's components, and reflected histological features. The tumor growth curve has two or three inflection points (x'') on the growth curve. Exposure of rats to both negative and positive corona discharges delayed tumor growth. While, body mass and tumor were activated by negative corona discharge (e--ion) and they grew 1.5 to 1.7-fold (body mass) and 1.2-fold (tumor) greater than in the respective control groups, finally. The effects of e--ion on growth may be via an induced chronic depolarizing response. Tumors in the e--ion group were cylindrical, extending toward the head, and these animals showed internal hemorrhaging after long term exposure. Rats exposed to the positive corona discharge (e+-ion) showed decreased body and tumor growth and survival. The circular tumors in the e+-ion group contained fibroblastic cells and a few apoptotic cells. These effects of e+-ion were thought to be due to a chronic hyperpolarizing response. Tumor growth under high voltage (HVE) showed a positive cooperative response (burst type cooperativity), which triggered at an early stage of tumor growth, and all internal organs merged mutually due to oppression by HVE. Therefore, the effects of electric fields, currents and high voltages, appear to be a stimulation of growth in the short term, but over the long term serious effects on health were seen.},

It affects about 45% of retirement home residents and overall more than 12% of the adult population. Severe fecal incontinence can be treated by the implantation of an artificial sphincter. Currently available implants, however, are not part of everyday surgery due to long-term re-operation rates of 95% and definitive explantation rates of 40%. Such figures suggest that the implants fail to reproduce the capabilities of the natural sphincter. This article reviews the artificial sphincters on the market and under development , presents their physical principles of operation and critically analyzes their performance. We highlight the geometrical and mechanical parameters crucial for the design of an artificial fecal sphincter and propose more advanced mechanisms of action for a biomimetic device with sensory feedback. Dielectric electro-active polymer actuators are especially attractive because of their versatility, response time, reaction forces, and energy consumption. The availability of such technology will enable fast pressure adaption comparable to the natural feedback mechanism, so that tissue atrophy and erosion can be avoided while maintaining continence during daily activities.},

This article reviews the results and conclusions obtained by several studies investigating the hemocompatibility, in vitro biocompatibility, inflammatory response, and in vivo tissue reactions of these two reference materials. Variable results obtained with LDPE and PDMS in ex vivo hemocompatibility studies were attributed to the type of animal model used, the flow velocity of the circulating blood, the time of exposure, and the methodology used to measure blood cell adhesion or activation at the surface of the materials. In contrast, both the LDPE and PDMS appeared to be suitable reference materials when used in in vitro biocompatibility, inflammatory response, and in vivo studies. However, caution must be taken when interpreting the results, because gamma sterilization of these two materials as well as their origin (for example PDMS) are two critically important factors. In conclusion, we see a definite need for standardized hemocompatible parameters and better high-quality hemocompatibility studies on PRM. This review also suggests other materials as potential PRM candidates, namely, Biomer® and Intramedic™ polyethylene. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

A zipping design in which the electric field is applied across the elastomer membrane was explored theoretically and experimentally. Single zipping chambers and a micropump body made of a three chambers connected by an embedded channel were wet-etched into a silicon wafer and subsequently covered by a gold-implanted silicone membrane. We measured static deflections of up to ȝP on chambers with square openings of 1.8 and 2.6 mm side, in very good agreement with our model.},

This paper presents analytical solutions to the problem of the uniform compression of bonded hollow circular elastic layers, which includes solid circular layers as a special case as the radius of hollow section vanishes. The closed-form expressions derived in this study are advanced in the sense that three of the commonly used assumptions in the analysis of bonded elastic layers are eliminated: (i) the incompressibility assumption, (ii) the "pressure" assumption and (iii) the assumption that plane sections remain plane after deformation. Through the use of the analytical solutions derived in the study, the compressive behavior of bonded circular discs is studied. Particular emphasis is given to the investigation of the effects of the existence of a central hole on the compression modulus, stress distributions and maximum stresses/strains in view of three key parameters: radius ratio of the hole, aspect ratio of the disc and Poisson's ratio of the disc material. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

On the basis of two kinematic assumptions and by means of variable transformation, the governing equations are derived. The double series approach provides a direct means of computation with second-order convergence. The solutions agree well with the published results for special cases of square layers and infinite strips, and with finite element results for rectangular layers. Besides illustrating the importance of including the compressibility effect, the numerical study shows that the effect of length-to-width ratio is significant on the effective compression modulus of rectangular pads.},

The analysis covers the effect of the frictional resistance of the supports on the vertical stiffness of this type of isolator. The most important aspect of these bearings is that they do not have end plates, which reduces their weight, but also means that they are not bonded to the upper and lower support surfaces and are held in place only by friction. This at first sight might seem to be a deficiency of this design, but it has the advantage that it eliminates the presence of tensile stresses in the bearings. It is these tensile stresses and the bonding requirements that arise from them that lead to the high costs of conventional isolation bearings. A theoretical analysis of the response of these bearings to vertical load shows that slip between the unbonded surfaces and rigid supports above and below can have a significant influence on the vertical stiffness and the internal pressure distribution.},

The bending of blocks is treated in a similar way, the pressure distribution in this case being derived from the corresponding bending stress function. The apparent shear of relatively thick blocks is then treated as a combination of shear and bending displacements. The location of an internal rupture and the deformation at which it occurs are also derived from a critical (negative) value of the pressure developed within the block, at which a small cavity increases indefinitely in size. The corresponding critical deformations are calculated for extension and bending displacements. The shear stresses developed at the bonded surfaces under extension, compression or bending displacements are also evaluated. Copyright © 1970 Society of Plastics Engineers, Inc.},

From the mechanical point of view, the main difference is that the fiber reinforcement cannot be considered rigid in extension as it is usually done for steel plates. In this paper an analytical model to analyze the compression and bending behavior of fiber-reinforced rectangular isolators is presented. The model takes into account, for the first time, both the reinforcement extensibility and the compressibility of the elastomer.

	abstract     = {The behavior of rubber layers under pure compression has been investigated to considerable extent in the literature. The most widely used approach is the so-called pressure solution, which is based on several assumptions, most notably that the stress state is dominated by the hydrostatic pressure. Other approaches have also been considered, but for nearly incompressible material and thin layers their predictions are very similar to those of the pressure solution. Nearly all past studies on the subject have focused on rubber layers that are bonded to either rigid or flexible supports (or reinforcement). Unreinforced (i.e., single layer) rubber pads are often installed as unbonded, i.e., without steel end plates connecting them to their top and bottom supports. In an unbonded application, rubber pads rely solely on friction to develop shear resistance along the contact interfaces. This shear resistance is necessary to provide the pad with an adequately large vertical stiffness. The effect of the frictional restraint along the top and bottom contact surfaces and the influence of partial slip have received very little attention in the literature. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis for the behavior of an unbonded rubber layer, including the effects of the elastomer's bulk compressibility and the contact slip at the supports. Results of a finite element analysis are also presented and shown to be in good agreement with the results of the theoretical analysis.},

Although the burden is considerable, current and accessible information on the prevalence, morbidity, and cost is sparse. This study was undertaken to estimate the economic burden of Gl and liver disease in the United States for use by policy makers, health care providers, and the public. Methods: Data were extracted from a number of publicly available and proprietary national databases to determine the prevalence, direct costs, and indirect costs for 17 selected Gl and liver diseases. Indirect cost calculations were purposefully very conservative. These costs were compared with National Institutes of Health (NIH) research expenditures for selected Gl and liver diseases. Results: The most prevalent diseases were non-food-borne gastroenteritis (135 million cases/year), food-borne illness (76 million), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD; 19 million), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; 15 million). The disease with the highest annual direct costs in the United States was GERD ($9.3 billion), followed by gallbladder disease ($5.8 billion), colorectal cancer ($4.8 billion), and peptic ulcer disease ($3.1 billion). The estimated direct costs for these 17 diseases in 1998 dollars were $36.0 billion, with estimated indirect costs of $22.8 billion. The estimated direct costs for all digestive diseases were $85.5 billion. Total NIH research expenditures were $676 million in 2000. Conclusions: Gl and liver diseases exact heavy economic and social costs in the United States. Understanding the prevalence and costs of these diseases is important to help set priorities to reduce the burden of illness.},

		Researchers have long been interested in capturing energy created by the mechanical motion of the human body and using it to power portable electronics, but the parts required for such a harvesting device tend to be bulky and stiff—not at all comfortable for humans.

		Researchers in the lab of University of Auckland associate professor Iain Anderson are developing soft generators that dispense with much of the external circuitry that makes the devices cumbersome. Thomas McKay, a research fellow at the university’s Biomimetics Laboratory, demonstrated their invention at the Materials Research Society’s fall meeting in Boston last month. As McKay strode around in front of the audience, LEDs on his right sneaker lit up when his heel struck the ground, generating electricity. “This shoe feels just like a shoe,” he said. “We’re generating energy here without affecting the experience of the user.”

All conceivable classes of materials with a wide range of mechanical, physical and chemical properties are employed, from liquids and gels to organic and inorganic solids. Functionalities never seen before are achieved. In this review we discuss soft robots which allow actuation with several degrees of freedom. We show that different actuation mechanisms lead to similar actuators, capable of complex and smooth movements in 3d space. We introduce latest research examples in sensor skin development and discuss ultraflexible electronic circuits, light emitting diodes and solar cells as examples. Additional functionalities of sensor skin, such as visual sensors inspired by animal eyes, camouflage, self-cleaning and healing and on-skin energy storage and generation are briefly reviewed. Finally, we discuss a paradigm change in energy harvesting, away from hard energy generators to soft ones based on dielectric elastomers. Such systems are shown to work with high energy of conversion, making them potentially interesting for harvesting mechanical energy from human gait, winds and ocean waves. Soft matter is in the focus of current materials research for the development of functional devices mimicking nature. The review focuses on soft robots, electronic skin and soft energy generators and storage elements.

To date, EIT has been used to image fast neural impedance changes during somatosensory evoked potentials and epileptiform discharges through the rat cerebral cortex with a resolution of 2 ​ms and <300 ​μm. However, imaging of neural activity in subcortical structures has never been achieved with this technique. Here, we evaluated the feasibility of using EIT to image epileptiform activity in the rat hippocampus using non-penetrating electrodes implanted on the cortical surface. Hippocampal epileptiform events, comprising repetitive 30–50 ​Hz ictal spikes, were induced by electrically stimulating the perforant path of rats anaesthetised with fentanyl-isoflurane. For each of ≥30 seizures, impedance measurements were obtained by applying 100 ​μA current at 1.4 ​kHz through an independent pair of electrodes on a 54-electrode planar epicortical array and recording boundary voltages on all remaining electrodes. EIT images of averaged ictal spikes were reconstructed using impedance recordings from all seizures in each animal. These revealed a focus of neural activity localised to the dentate gyrus which was spatially and temporally aligned to local field potential (LFP) recordings and could be reconstructed reproducibly in all animals with a localisation accuracy of ≤400 ​μm (p ​< ​0.03125, N ​= ​5). These findings represent the first experimental evidence of the ability of EIT to image neural activity in subcortical structures from the surface of the cortex with high spatiotemporal resolution and suggest that this method may be used for improving understanding of functional connectivity between cortico-hippocampal networks in both physiological and pathophysiological states.},

Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an excellent candidate for safe, low cost, and noninvasive breast cancer monitoring. Despite early promises, the EIT faces a few challenges for the breast imaging application. It is mainly due to its limited resolution and especially for the tumors in depth. However, unlike the other medical applications of EIT, such as brain and thorax, breast tissues are deformable. This article exploits the deformation of breast shape to enhance the EIT resolution and its depth detection. Exterior boundary of the breast can be used to create deformable EIT with multiple shapes to enhance the imaging resolution, turning a challenge to an opportunity. With deformation of the boundary shape, more independent measurements can be obtained, and hence, more information can be gained. This can increase the resolution of the reconstructed image and possible detection for smaller tumors in depth. This article demonstrates it by experimental verification in phantom test representing tumor size inclusion deep inside the breast by a few deformed shape phantoms. To evaluate the experimental results, 3-D printed phantoms are built in several different shapes. Quantitative image analysis shows that some of the deformed shapes are superior to a traditional circular cross section. Additionally, we proposed a combination of data from all shapes so that all this information can be used in one step reconstruction to achieve higher imaging accuracy.},

In this paper, the development of a portable, reliable and low-cost EIT system for image reconstruction by using an embedded system (ES) is introduced herein. The novelty of this article is the hardware development of a complete low-cost EIT system, as well as three simple and efficient algorithms that can be implemented on ES. The proposed EIT system applies the adjacent voltage method, starting with an impedance acquisition stage that sends data to a Raspberry Pi 4 (RPi4) as ES. To perform the image reconstruction, a user interface was developed by using GNU Octave for RPi4 and the EIDORS library. A statistical analysis is performed to determine the best average value from the samples measured by using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with a capacity of 30 kSPS and 24-bit resolution. The tests for the proposed EIT system were performed using materials such as metal, glass and an orange to simulate its application in food industry. Experimental results show that the statistical median is more accurate with respect to the real voltage measurement; however, it represents a higher computational cost. Therefore, the mean is calculated and improved by discarding data values in a transitory state, achieving better accuracy than the median to determine the real voltage value, enhancing the quality of the reconstructed images. A performance comparison between a personal computer (PC) and RPi4 is presented. The proposed EIT system offers an excellent cost-benefit ratio with respect to a traditional PC, taking into account precision, accuracy, energy consumption, price, light weight, size, portability and reliability. The proposed EIT system has potential application in mechanical ventilation, food industry and structural health monitoring.},

	abstract     = {Smooth muscle is found throughout the body where it serves a variety of functions. It is in the stomach and intestines where it helps with digestion and nutrient collection. It is found throughout the urinary system where it functions to help rid the body of toxins and works in electrolyte balance. It is found throughout arteries and veins where it plays a vital role in the regulation of blood pressure and tissue oxygenation. Without these vital functions the body would not be able to maintain even it's most basic functions. Smooth muscle differs from skeletal muscle in a variety of ways, perhaps the most important being its ability to be contracted and controlled involuntarily. The nervous system can use smooth muscle to tightly regulate many of the bodies subsystems for life with no thought from the user. A person does not need to think about their blood pressure for it to adapt to increasing oxygen demands from exercise. The nervous system instead uses hormones, neurotransmitters, and other receptors to control smooth muscle spontaneously.  Smooth muscle also plays an important role in the disease process throughout the body. The use of bronchodilators to relax airway smooth muscle is an important and life-saving treatment in asthmatics.[1] Likewise, medications like metoclopramide can stimulate and promote gastric emptying by increasing smooth muscle signaling. Perhaps one of the most well-known uses of medical therapy and smooth muscle is the use of nitrates in the treatment of ischemic heart disease[2] where nitrates, in combination with ACEI, can improve patient mortality.[3] The singularly large impact that smooth muscle has throughout the body makes it an important topic for medical professionals to understand. As many treatments at their core rely on modifying the signaling pathways that affect smooth muscle.},

	abstract     = {Penile erection is a vascular phenomenon that results from smooth muscle relaxation, arterial dilation and venous restriction. The atherosclerosis of the penis that occurs with aging causes a decrease in penile oxygen tension. A reduction of smooth muscle cells has been demonstrated in relation with this change in oxygen tension. Changes in the ratio of penile collagen have also been observed and could explain the decrease in penile elasticity and compliance. Chronic ischemia is, therefore, associated with fibrosis but also with nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate. The sensitivity of the α-adrenoceptors on the smooth muscle cells increases with aging. All those modifications can explain the prevalence of erectile dysfunction with aging. Low oxygen tension in prostanoid production may also play a role in the mechanism of ischemia-induced cavernosal fibrosis; however, intracavernous injections of prostaglandin E1 do not seem to modify the intracavernous structures by reducing muscular atrophy. The effects of androgen on libido and sexual behavior are well established, but their role in the human erectile mechanism remains unclear. Several studies performed on animals have demonstrated impacts directly on both the physiological function and the trabecular structure of the corpora cavernosa in rats, dogs and rabbits. However, in humans, no study seems to demonstrate a role of testosterone on muscular atrophy or penile neurologic control. Testosterone treatment alters the human behavior but not penile physiologic processes. Further studies are necessary to explain the real role of testosterone not only on the peripheral mechanism of erection but also on the central control. © 2002 Nature Publishing Group.

In this paper, we show our performance evaluation of different EIT drive patterns, specifically strategies for electrode selection when performing current injection and voltage measurements. We compare voltage data with Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Boundary Voltage Changes (BVC), and study image quality with Size Error (SE), Position Error (PE) and Ringing (RNG) parameters, in the case of one-point and two-point simultaneous contact locations. The study shows that, in order to improve the performance of EIT based sensors, the electrode selection strategies should dynamically change correspondingly to the location of the input stimuli. In fact, the selection of one drive pattern over another can improve the target size detection and position accuracy up to 4.7% and 18%, respectively.},

The electrical resistivity for the longitudinal direction was measured as a function of filler volume fraction to understand the electrical percolation behavior. The electrical percolation threshold (EPT) of CIPs-PDMS composite cured under a magnetic field can be as low as 0.1 vol%, which is much less than most of those studies in particulate composites. Meanwhile, the effects of compressive strain on the electrical properties of CIPs-PDMS composites were also investigated. The strain sensitivity depends on filler volume fraction and decreases with the increasing of compressive strain. It has been found that the composites containing a small amount of CI particles curing under a magnetic field exhibit a high strain sensitivity of over 150. Based on the morphological observation of the composite structures, a two-dimensional stick percolation model for the CIPs-PDMS composites has been established. The Monte Carlo simulation is performed to obtain the percolation probability. The simulation results in prediction of the values of EPTs are close to that of experimental measurements. It demonstrates that the low percolation behavior of CIPs-PDMS composites is due to the average length of particle chains forming by external magnetic field.},

Moreover, the contribution of the electrodes into the lumped series resistance is not accurately known. The aim of this work is to define the accuracy and frequency limits of the LEM and to derive the exact values of its lumped components. This is achieved by developing a detailed three-dimensional distributed-element model (DEM) of the transducer structure. Based thereon, analytical expressions are developed for the LEM components and limits are explored. Through numerical evaluation of the DEM it is found that only two-third of the single-polarity electrode resistance contributes to the lumped series resistance, which is three times lower than predicted by existing models. Comparison between the LEM and DEM further shows that the LEM is adequate for frequencies significantly below the cutoff frequency. Thereafter, capacitance and resistance fall off as a result of signal propagation limitations. This has been experimentally verified. The developed DEM and established validity range of the simple LEM allows for more accurate sensors and better optimized transducers designs, with up to three times less electrode material.},

This type of structural feature allows DEs to generate large displacement outputs owing to the nonlinear electromechanical coupling and time-dependent viscoelastic behavior. The major challenge is to properly actuate the nonlinear soft materials in applications of robotic manipulations. To characterize the complex time-dependent viscoelasticity of the DEs, a nonlinear rheological model is proposed to describe the time-dependent viscoelastic behaviors of DEs by combining the advantages of the Kelvin–Voigt model and the generalized Maxwell model. We adopt a Monte Carlo statistical simulation method as an auxiliary method, to the best knowledge of the author which has never reportedly been used in this field, to improve the quantitative prediction ability of the generalized model. The proposed model can simultaneously describe the DE deformation processes under step voltage and alternating voltage excitation. Comparisons between the numerical simulation results and experimental data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generalized rheological model with a maximum prediction error of 3.762% and root-mean-square prediction error of 9.03%. The results presented herein can provide theoretical guidance for the design of viscoelastic DE actuators and serve as a basis for manipulation control to suppress the viscoelastic creep and increase the speed response of the dielectric elastomer actuators (DEA).},

	abstract     = {Efficient and accurate detection of pressure applied on diverse surfaces is essential for pressure sensors. In this paper, a flexible pressure sensor based on thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU)-carbon black (CB) conductive composite and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is introduced. The conductivity of the composite is sensitive and linearly responsive to external pressure signal, which is feasible for reconstructing pressure distribution by using EIT technique that measures voltage on the boundary of the composite and then reconstructs conductivity changes in the composite. The pressure sensor is fabricated by screen printing TPU-CB composite and Ag electrode layer on flexible Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheet, which shows excellent portability and full flexibility. Meanwhile, it requires few sensing units and internal transmission wires, beneficial for nondestructive measurement towards targets. We successfully use the pressure sensor to estimate the location and value of pressure applied on single or multiple regions, and further detect daily objects for practical applications, demonstrating the sensing ability of the pressure sensor. Our sensor has bright prospect in the fields of bionic skin in intelligent robots, wearable electrical devices, motion monitoring systems and touch-control instruments.},

	abstract     = {Electrical Impedance Tomography and Spectroscopy (EITS) is a noninvasive imaging technique that creates images of cross-sections “tomos” of objects by discriminating them based on their electrical impedance. This thesis investigated and successfully confirmed the use of Code Division Multiplexing (CDM) using Gold codes in Electrical Impedance Tomography and Spectroscopy. The results obtained showed 3.5% and 6.2% errors in determining the position and size of imaged anomalies respectively, with attainable imaging speed of 462 frames/second. These results are better, compared to those reported when using Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM).This new approach provides a more robust mode of EITS for fast changing dynamic systems by eliminating temporal data inconsistencies. Furthermore, it enables robust use of frequency difference imaging and spectroscopy in EITS by eliminating frequency data inconsistencies. In this method of imaging, electric current patterns are safely injected into the imaged object by a set of electrodes arranged in a single plane on the objects surface, for 2-Dimensional (2D) imaging. For 3-Dimensional (3D) imaging, more electrode planes are used on the objects surface. The injected currents result in measurable voltages on the objects surface. Such voltages are measured, and together with the input currents, and a Finite Element Model (FEM) of the object, used to reconstruct an impedance image of the cross-sectional contents of the imaged object. The reconstruction process involves the numerical solutions of the forward problem; using Finite Element solvers and the resulting ill-posed inverse problem using iterative Optimization or Computational Intelligence methods. This method has applications mainly in the Biomedical imaging and Process monitoring fields. The primary interests of the author are, in imaging and diagnosis of cancer, neonatal pneumonia and neurological disorders which are leading causes of death in Africa and world-wide.},

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking’ were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history’. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

One traditional approach is to fabricate a large number of taxels, each delivering an individual, isolated response to a stimulus. In contrast, we propose a method where the sensor simply consists of a continuous volume of piezoresistive elastomer with a number of electrodes embedded inside. We measure piezoresistive effects between all pairs of electrodes in the set, and count on this rich signal set containing the information needed to pinpoint contact location with high accuracy using regression algorithms. In our validation experiments, we demonstrate submillimeter median accuracy in locating contact on a 10mm by 16mm sensor using only four electrodes (creating six unique pairs). In addition to extracting more information from fewer wires, this approach lends itself to simple fabrication methods and makes no assumptions about the underlying geometry, simplifying future integration on robot fingers.}

This paper investigates the properties and effects of these two kinds of error on 2D resistivity imaging or inversion for practical applications. By analytic analysis and numerical simulations, the off-line and in-line electrode spacing errors were quantitatively estimated for all common electrode arrays (pole-pole, pole-dipole, pole-bipole, Wenner, Schlumberger, dipole-dipole, γ-array, Wenner-β) in 2D resistivity imaging surveys. Meanwhile, the spreading patterns of the spacing errors in the pseudosection and the possible artefacts in the imaging (inverted model) are evaluated. We show that the magnitude of the spacing errors are quite different with these arrays, being largest for dipole-dipole, Wenner-β and γ-array surveys, for which a 10% in-line spacing error may cause twice as large an error (>20%) in the observed resistance or apparent resistivity, which in turn will produce some artefacts in the inverted model. The observed potential errors obtained with the reciprocity principle and collected from different sites and with different electrode arrays, were analysed to show the properties of the potential error caused by many aspects in the field. Using logarithmic plots and error pseudosections, we found that with different electrode arrays and at different sites the potential errors demonstrate a general property, which may be regarded as a negative-power function of potential reading. Power net transients, background telluric variation and instrument malfunction are possible sources that may cause the large errors present as outliers deviating from this function. We reaffirm the fact that the outliers are often correlated with high contact resistances for some of the electrodes used in a measurement, but this may also be caused by an unsatisfactory connection between the electrode and the cable due to, for example, dirt or oxide on the connectors. These outliers are often the main part of the errors affecting the imaging results. Furthermore, a robust inversion and a smoothness-constrained inversion were applied to the investigation of the effects of the measurement errors. Using two real data sets, we show that the smoothness-constrained least-squares inversion is much more sensitive to the potential errors than the robust inversion, but the two inversion schemes produce very similar models with a high data quality. Artefacts or indefinite parts in the inverted models correlate with the distribution zones of the outliers in the potential error pseudosection.},

With the proposed model, different textures of PyC, were tested under six different loading modes. The calculated elastic modulus were coincided with the reported experimental results approximately. In particular, the influence of OA of PyC on Young’s modulus was investigated. The results show that the Poisson’s ratio and Young’s module of PyC tend to be isotropic when OA is higher than 110°and the shear modulus becomes isotopic with OA higher than 50. The results demonstrate that the proposed model would provide a valuable numerical tool to predicate the elastic properties of PyC.}

One “test” prosthesis was cycled through  flexion-extension (90°–30°) with a dynamic load of 10 N, whilst immersed in a lubricant of dilute bovine serum. Additionally, a static load of 100 N was applied for 45 s every 3000 cycles to simulate a static gripping force. A second “control” prosthesis was immersed in the same lubricant to account for absorption. Gravimetric and Sa (3D roughness) measurements were taken at 1,000,000 cycle intervals. Micrographs and Sa values revealed negligible change to the CoCr surfaces after 5,000,000 cycles. The UHMWPE also exhibited no distinctive Sa trend, however the micrographs indicate that polishing occurred. Both the CoCr and UHMWPE test components progressively decreased in weight. The CoCr control component did not change in weight, whilst the UHMWPE component gained weight through absorption. To account for the disparity between surface and gravimetric results, the hydroxyapatite coatings were examined. Micrographs of the test stems revealed that the hydroxyapatite coating was partially removed, whilst the micrographs of the control stems exhibited a uniform coating.},

Methods: Proximal interphalangeal implants (9 Ti, 8 Py) were placed into rabbit knees and the animals were killed after 3 months. Subsidence was assessed by monthly x-rays. Mechanical stability was measured with a nondestructive pullout test. Implant osseointegration was evaluated by an analysis of the relative implant-calcified bone contact surface on microradiographs and by a histomorphometric analysis of the percentage of bone and connective tissue contact with the implant surface. Histologic examination included assessment of bone apposition on the basis of fluorochromes. Results: Subsidence was found in all 8 Py implants but in none of the Ti group. All 9 Ti implants were mechanically stable; all 8 Py implants were loose. A significantly higher implant-bone contact was found for the Ti group compared with the Py group. Bone apposition increased with time and was highest for the Ti implants 6 weeks after implantation. Conclusions: In the rabbit model osseointegration of implants was highly dependent on the material. A reliable osseointegration was found for Ti implants. For Py implants no osseointegration or implant stability was achieved. For use of small joints of the hand we therefore recommend Ti-based implants. Copyright © 2006 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand.},

Methods: The study comprised an analysis of 170 PIP joint pyrocarbon arthroplasties in 99 patients with a minimum 2-year clinical follow-up. Diagnoses included inflammatory arthritis (n = 49), posttraumatic arthritis (n = 29), and osteoarthritis (n = 92). Univariate logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed. Results: At an average follow-up of 6 years (range, 2–14 years), 58 reoperations (34%) were required, including 36 (21%) involving implant revision surgery. The majority of revisions were performed for either dislocations (n = 16) or pain and stiffness (n = 14). The 5- and 10-year survival-free of revision surgery rates were 79% and 77%, respectively. The risk for revision surgery was higher in patients with posttraumatic arthritis. There were 15 intraoperative complications involving a fracture and 26 postoperative complications, including 21 dislocations. In unrevised implants, patients had significant improvements in their preoperative to postoperative pain levels, with no change in their PIP joint total arc of motion. At a mean radiographic follow-up of 5.4 years, there were 28% with grade 3+ loosening and 36% with progressive implant instability. Implant loosening or progressive instability was not associated with worse pain or PIP joint total arc of motion. Conclusions: Approximately 1 in 5 PIP joint arthroplasties with a pyrocarbon implant will require revision surgery by 5 years, and 1 in 3 will undergo more than 1 operation. Furthermore, 1 in 4 PIP joint arthroplasties will have grade 3+ radiographic loosening and 1 in 3 will have progressive loosening or subsidence by 5 years. These results are particularly concerning in young patients and those with posttraumatic arthritis. Overall, in patients that do not require revision surgery, pain relief was improved and motion maintained. Type of study/level of evidence: Therapeutic IV.},

The goals of the finger joint implant arthroplasty are to relieve pain, to correct deformity, and to improve the function and appearance of the hand. Several prosthetic implants have been used for the replacement of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. Pyrocarbon materials, a form of pyrolytic carbon, a ceramic-like material, have proven to be strong, durable, resistant to wear and nonreactive in the body. The Ascension PIP pyrocarbon total joint is a bicondylar, anatomically shaped, articulating implant that allows joint flexion–extension, while providing some restriction of adduction–abduction motion. A review of the literature of pyrocarbon PIP prosthesis reveals little clinical data. The case of a 33-year-old man with posttraumatic arthritis proximal interphalangeal joint right long finger is reported. The case was treated surgically using the Ascension PIP total joint. During the insertion of the implant, the proximal component fractured at the sub-articular collar. The component was removed, and a new implant was inserted without complication. Critical evaluation revealed that there was an inadequate resection of the volar lip resulting in a stress riser on the implant during impaction. Careful attention to this technical point will hopefully minimize the occurrence of this complication as the availability and use of these implants increases.},

In addition to wear secondary to bony impingement, these flaws can be introduced through manufacturing, surgical handling, and in vivo frictional wear. In an effort to identify an elastomeric material that will function similarly to Silastic as a self-hinging joint spacer but provide an increased functional life, we have investigated and compared the crack-growth properties of two polyurethanes, ChronoFlex and Medicaflex, and a thermoplastic elastomer, Santoprene, with those of Silastic. The materials were evaluated after sterilization by either ethylene oxide or gamma irradiation in an ASTM standard flexing machine under conditions of high humidity and body temperature both before and after artificially aging. In each case, the materials investigated presented significantly lower crack-growth rates than Silastic (p < 0.001).},

However, little is known about the functions in fissural cortex including BA2 and BA3. We aim at drawing a refined and detailed somatosensory homunculus of the entire S1. Methods: We recruited 20 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who underwent stereo-electroencephalography for preoperative assessments. Direct electrical stimulation was performed for functional mapping. Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates of the stimulation sites lying in S1 were acquired. Results: Stimulation of 177 sites in S1 yielded 149 positive sites (84%), most of which were located in the sulcal cortex. The spatial distribution of different body-part representations across the S1 surface revealed that the gross medial-to-lateral sequence of body representations within the entire S1 was consistent with the classical “homunculus”. And we identified several unreported body-part representations from the sulcal cortex, such as forehead, deep elbow and wrist joints, and some dorsal body regions. Conclusions: Our results reveal general somatotopical characteristics of the entire S1 cortex and differences with the previous works of Penfield. Significance: The classical S1 homunculus was extended by providing further refinement and additional detail.},

	abstract     = {Background: The metacarpophalangeal joint is the most commonly involved joint when rheumatoid arthritis affects the hand. Many prosthetic implants have been designed for the replacement of this joint. Although studies of these implants have shown relief of pain, they have generally demonstrated a poor range of motion, progression of ulnar drift, and bone loss, as well as failure, fracture, and dislocation of the implant. Methods: From December 1979 to February 1987, 151 pyrolytic carbon metacarpophalangeal implants were inserted in fifty-three patients. The implants had an articulating, unconstrained design with a hemispherical head and grooved, offset stems. Forty-four patients had rheumatoid arthritis; five, posttraumatic arthritis; three, osteoarthritis; and one, systemic lupus erythematosus. Three patients (eleven implants) were lost to long-term follow-up, and twenty patients (fifty-one functioning implants) died after the implant had been in situ for an average of 7.2 years. Eighteen implants (12 percent) in eleven patients were revised. Fourteen of the eighteen implants were replaced with a silicone-elastomer or another type of implant, and the remaining four were removed and a pyrolytic carbon implant was reinserted with the addition of bone cement or bone graft, or both, Twenty-six patients (seventy-one implants) were available for long-term review at an average of 11.7 years (range, 10.1 to 16.0 years) after implantation. Results: The implants improved the arc of motion of the fingers by an average of 13 degrees and elevated the arc by an average of 16 degrees. As a result, fingers were in a more functional, extended position. A complete set of preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up radiographs was available for fifty-three of the seventy-one implants that were followed long term. There was a high prevalence of joint stability: fifty (94 percent) of the fifty-three implants were in a reduced position postoperatively, and forty-one (82 percent) of those fifty implants were still in the postoperative reduced position at the time of long-term follow-up. Ulnar deviation averaged 20 degrees preoperatively and 19 degrees at the time of follow-up, with only the long finger having an increase in deviation. No adverse remodeling or resorption of bone was seen. Fifty (94 percent) of the fifty-three implants had evidence of osseointegration, with sclerosis around the end and shaft of the prosthetic stems. Radiolucent changes were seen adjacent to twelve implants. There was minimum-to-moderate subsidence (four millimeters or less) of thirty-four implants; most of the subsidence occurred immediately postoperatively. Survivorship analysis demonstrated an average annual failure rate of 2.1 percent and a sixteen-year survival rate of 70.3 percent. The five and ten-year survival rates were 82.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 74.6 to 88.2 percent) and 81.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 73.0 to 87.8 percent), respectively. None of the revised implants had any visible changes of wear or deformity of the surfaces or stems. Four instances of chronic inflammatory tissue and three instances of proliferative synovitis were noted histologically. Focal pigment deposits were seen in three fingers, one of which had removal of the implant two months after a fracture. No evidence of intracellular particles or particulate synovitis was found. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that pyrolytic carbon is a biologically and biomechanically compatible, wear-resistant, and durable material for arthroplasty of the metacarpophalangeal joint.},

Furthermore, radiographs were evaluated for deviations from the longitudinal finger axis. In our registry, 279 surface replacing implants and 424 silicone implants have been documented. The overall complication rate was 20% for surface replacements and 11% for silicone arthroplasties (p ≤ 0.01) with soft tissue-related events being the most prevalent in both groups. Reoperations were significantly more frequent after surface replacement (5.4%) than silicone arthroplasty (0.5%; p ≤ 0.001), while the revision rates did not differ significantly (4.4% and 3.3%, respectively; p = 0.542). Postoperative axis deviations were significantly less frequent in the surface replacement group (19% versus 58% for silicone arthroplasty; p ≤ 0.001). We recommend using a surface replacing implant in fingers with preoperative axis deviations and correctable anatomical situation, bearing in mind the higher risk of a second surgery.

Methods 10 patients each with primary osteoarthritis of a single PIP joint were assessed preoperatively (baseline), at 6 weeks, and 3, 6, and 12 months after CapFlex-PIP arthroplasty for lateral stability and range of motion of the affected digit. In addition, patients rated their pain using a numeric rating scale and function and overall assessment of their treatment and condition using the quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) and Patient Evaluation Measure (PEM) questionnaires, respectively. Results The mean baseline active mobility of the affected PIP joint increased from 42 to 51 by one year, although this change was not significant. Patients reported reduced pain at one year, which was statistically significant. There was also a significant improvement between baseline and one-year QuickDASH (43 points vs 15 points, respectively) and PEM scores (51 vs 25 points, respectively). Absent or low lateral instability was observed in 9 joints at follow-up. All implants remained intact over the one-year postoperative period and there was no migration, osteolysis, or implant fracture. After study completion, 2 patients underwent tenolysis. Conclusions Patients experienced a significant reduction in pain and a trend towards increased mobility. All implants showed complete osteointegration without evidence of radiological migration. Lateral stability improved. (J Hand Surg Am. 2015;40(2):334e340. Type of study/level of evidence Therapeutic IV.},

While "failure" is generally associated with fracture, it is recognised that fracture does not always necessitate replacement of the Swanson prosthesis. Fracture tends to occur at the junction of the distal stem and hinge of the prosthesis. Initial improvements in ulnar deviation and range of motion (ROM) tend to be gradually reduced over the duration of implantation, and there is little evidence to suggest any long-term improvement in hand strength. Bone erosion and silicone synovitis have been seen but at a much lesser incidence than in other joints implanted with silicone spacers. An evaluation of retrieved Swanson prostheses, tied in with patient history and hand measurements might provide additional information to improve the design of the Swanson prosthesis itself and of other finger prostheses.},

	abstract     = {Artificial finger joint design has been developed through different stages through the past. PIP (proximal interphalangeal) and MCP (metacarpophalangeal) artificial finger joints have come to replace the amputation and arthrodesis options; although, these artificial joints are still facing challenges related to reactive tissues, reduced range of motion, and flexion and extension deficits. Swanson silicone artificial finger joints are still common due to the physician's preferability of silicone with the dorsal approach during operation. Nevertheless, other artificial finger joints such as the pyrocarbon implant arthroplasty have also drawn the interests of practitioners. Artificial finger joint has been classified under three major categories which are constrained, unconstrained, and linked design. There are also challenges such as concerns of infections and articular cartilage necrosis associated with attempted retention of vascularity. In addition, one of the main challenges facing the silicone artificial finger joints is the fracture occurring at the distal stem with the hinge. The aim of this paper is to review the different artificial finger joints in one paper as there are few old review papers about them. Further studies need to be done to develop the design and materials of the pyrocarbon and silicone implants to increase the range of motion associated with them and the fatigue life of the silicone implants.}

	abstract     = {In 2018, we reported 30 explanted NeuFlex Ò implants with fractures at various sites. Subsequently, we have encountered two more cases of early catastrophic failures of NeuFlex Ò metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint implants at the hinge. A 45-year-old man with painful thumb MCP joint arthritis received a NeuFlex Ò MCP joint arthroplasty in another hospital. Initially, he reported good pain relief and movement, but within 4 months, he experienced significant thumb pain, with reduced strength and movement. On examination at 1 year postopera-tively, there was mild MCP joint instability with lateral stressing, opening to 20 ulnarly and radially. Radiographs showed a NeuFlex Ò implant in situ with no adverse features. Following failed non-operative treatment, the implant was removed and was found to be fractured at the hinge. The bone implant interfaces looked normal with a thin shiny lining membrane, with no obvious inflammation and no bone spikes to explain the failure. The arthro-plasty was converted to an arthrodesis with good pain relief and thumb function. The second and third cases occurred in a 55-year-old lady with rheumatoid arthritis who presented with bilateral index finger MCP joint pain. In 2013, she had a right index finger NeuFlex Ò size 30 arthroplasty with a very good outcome, achieving a range of motion from 0-50 and good pain relief. Upon request, she underwent the same procedure for her left index finger in 2016, with a NeuFlex Ò size 30 implant MCP joint arthroplasty for her left index finger. The surgery and postoperative rehabilitation were performed in exactly the same manner as her right side. She initially reported good relief of her preoperative symptoms but by 3 months postopera-tively had developed recurrent pain. No cause was found, and the joint was re-explored at 6 months postoperatively. The implant was again found to be fractured at the hinge, with no evidence of bone spikes or infection. As the patient had done well on the right hand, the arthroplasty was revised with another size 30 NeuFlex Ò implant. The postoperative regimen was more conservative, with restricted mobilization and prolonged splintage to beyond 6 weeks postopera-tively. Initially, she reported good pain relief, but within 4 months of the operation she developed recurrent pain, stiffness and weakness. Her radio-graphs were again unremarkable (Figure 1(a) and (b)). The left index finger MCP joint was re-explored after a year (delayed due to other medical causes) and the implant was found to be fractured at the hinge (Figure 1(c)) for no obvious reason. The implant was changed to a size 7 Swanson implant with the stems trimmed to fit the bone tunnels. She achieved good pain relief and mobility with no evidence of implant failure after 2 years. The failure of NeuFlex Ò implants at the hinge has only recently been identified (Joyce and Giddins, 2018). We reported on 30 NeuFlex Ò explants: seven were intact; nine had fractured at the junction of the body and distal stem; 11 at the hinge; and three at both the distal stem and hinge. These further cases have identified a risk of catastrophic early failure of NeuFlex Ò implants at their hinge. No other silastic finger joint implant has been shown to fail so quickly, although some patients have had early revision of silastic arthroplasties (Trail et al., 2004) for disloca-tion. Although an implant could fail due to fatigue},

Based on biocompatible materials, we have developed a new type of thin, flexible pulsation sensor (FPS) which is wrapped around a graft to monitor blood pressure and flow. The FPS used carbon black (CB) nanoparticles dispersed in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as a piezoresistive sensor layer, which was encapsulated within structural PDMS layers and connected to stainless steel interconnect leads. Because the FPS is more flexible than natural arteries, veins, and synthetic vascular grafts, it can be wrapped around target conduits at the time of surgery and remain implanted for long-term monitoring. In this study, we analyze strain transduction from a blood vessel and characterize the electrical and mechanical response of CB-PDMS from 0-50% strain. An optimum concentration of 14 wt% CB-PDMS was used to fabricate 300-&#x03BC;m thick FPS devices with elastic modulus under 500 kPa, strain range of over 50%, and gauge factor greater than 5. Sensors were tested <formula><tex>$in\ vitro$</tex></formula> on vascular grafts with flows of 0-1,100 mL/min. <formula><tex>$In\ vitro$</tex></formula> testing showed linear output to pulsatile flows and pressures.

The development of commercial devices has thus far focused on the quality of measurements and their robustness in all field cases. However, both their costs and lack of flexibility to adapt to specific applications have limited their prevalence in the environmental sector. This article presents the development of a low-cost, open hardware resistivity meter to provide the scientific community with a robust and flexible tool for small-scale experiments. Called OhmPi, this basic resistivity meter features current injection and measurement functions associated with a multiplexer that allows performing automatic measurements with up to 32 electrodes (at a cost of less than $500). The device was first tested using a soil-analog electrical circuit to verify the reliability and robustness of the measurements. Results show that OhmPi offers a wide range of resistance measurements, from 0.2 to 1000 O, for contact resistances between 100 and 5000 O. Measurements were then carried out on a small field experiment, in demonstrating good stability of the OhmPi measurements, as well as a strong correlation with the output of a commercial reference instrument.},

Our approach enables the user to detect touch across the surface of the forearm by wearing two bands, one each on the lower and upper forearm. EIM uses a conductive substance to identify the area being touched. We focused on the electrical conductivity of the skin and applied EIM to the forearm. The two bands have electrodes on the inside. Signals are applied to these electrodes, and the resulting voltage on the surface of the skin is then measured. The advantages of our approach are that it works over a large area of the forearm, and can recognize both hand gestures and touch.},

The large appeal of using smart material actuators stems from their high mechanical energy density. However, all smart material actuators generally have at least one shortcoming involving either mechanical stroke, force, or frequency capability. Whenever speed is a consideration, piezoelectric actuation is the most commonly employed. The purpose of this paper is to review the most current trends in piezoelectric actuation architectures.

A DE is essentially a highly deformable capacitor, consisting of a thin elastomer membrane coated with compliant electrodes. A novel solution is proposed to perform a nonintrusive pressure measurement, in which a DE membrane is wrapped around the injection tube (patient line). While pressure is applied to the tube it expands, leading to an extension of the sensor and therefore to a significant increase in DE capacitance. First, a test rig is designed in order to measure the expansion of the polymer tube during pressure application. Multiple experiments are then performed to evaluate the tube deformation at different pressure levels. Subsequently, analytical models are developed for both fabric-reinforced injection tube and DE sensor, in order to predict the resulting capacitive change of the DE as well as to approximate the mechanical properties of the tube. Based on model predictions and tube characterization results, membrane DEs with different sensor geometries are developed, manufactured, and characterized. The sensor performance is finally assessed by means of several experiments, showing remarkable performance for pressures up to 62 bar.},

The baseline updates are triggered by fingertip contact and movement detections. Further, we support unidirectional stretching sensing using a model-based approach which works separately with continuous contact sensing. We also provide a software toolkit for users to design and deploy personalized interfaces with customized sensors.

We report on the first metallosis case occurring in a patient who received Bryan Disc implantation approximately 8 years earlier. She was involved in a traffic accident and sustained a whiplash injury to the cervical spine one and a half years ago. The traumatic Bryan Disc loosening developed after the traffic accident, causing metallosis. Results To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of spinal metallosis caused by the Bryan Disc. A series of metallosis cases reported in the literature are also reviewed. Conclusions Although uncommon, intraspinal metallosis or metalloma should be considered as an infrequent cause of delayed neurological symptoms after spinal surgery involving metallic instrumentation, especially after disc arthroplasty. Once metallosis is suspected, immediate metallic implant removal is mandatory for definite diagnosis and treatment.},

The carbon nanotubes used for the development of the material are multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) dispersed in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) prepolymer. The sensor was fabricated using the direct ink writing (DIW) technique (also referred to as robocasting). The MWCNT-PDMS composite was directly printed onto the polydimethylsiloxane substrate. The sensor response was then examined based on the resistance change to the applied load. The sensor exhibited high sensitivity (6.3 Ω/kPa) over a wide range of applied pressure (up to 1132 kPa); the highest observed measurement range for MWCNT-PDMS composite in previous work was 40 kPa. The formulated MWCNT-PDMS composite was also printed into high-resolution 3-dimensional shapes which maintained their form even after heat treatment process.

	abstract     = {Stretchable physical sensors are crucial for the development of advanced electrical systems, particularly wearable devices and soft robotics. Currently available stretchable sensors that detect both pressure and strain are based on piezoelectric, piezoresistive, or piezocapacitive effects. The range of pressure sensing is 1–800 kPa with large deformations being within the range of deformations of parts of the human body, such as elbows and knees. However, these devices cannot easily allow simultaneous and independent detection of pressure and strain with sensor arrays at large tensions (> 50%) because strain affects the pressure signal. In this study, we propose a monolithic silicone-based array of pressure and strain sensors that can simultaneously and independently detect the in-plane biaxial tensile deformation and pressure. To realize these functionalities, the deformation of the device structure was optimized using a hetero-silicone substrate made of two types of silicone with different hardness characteristics and porous silicone bodies. In addition, the resistances of the sensors were controlled by adjusting a mixture based on carbon nanoparticles to improve the sensitivity and independence between the pressure and strain sensors. These concepts demonstrate the potential of this approach and its compatibility with the current architectures of stretchable physical sensors.},

To create such a flexible strain sensor array, formation of a reliable interconnection between the elastic sensitive regions and the rigid contact regions is vital to achieve required sensitivity and durability. In this work, a new design with an added interconnect layer on top of the interface regions is used to reduce the bending induced local stress. A stretchable conductive composite by blending carbon black (CB) with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and Ecoflex (CB-PDMS/Ecoflex) is developed for the interconnect layer. CB-PDMS/Ecoflex is compatible with the blade coating for facile processing, and demonstrates a similar low Young's modulus as that of the sensitive region composed of silver nanowires and PDMS. Printing processes are developed to fabricate a 4 × 9 flexible strain sensor array based on the proposed design and the interconnect layer. It is shown that the sensor with CB-PDMS/Ecoflex interconnect layer can sustain more than 3000 bending cycles. Finally, the sensor array is integrated with a flexible active-matrix organic light-emitting diode display to construct the bendable interactive surface, demonstrating the capability of controlling the ball movement via bending gestures.},

On the basis of these parameters, different models have been proposed aimed at the prediction of the conductivity or the percolation concentration.

Only studies conducted by inhalation and intratracheal administration in rats have shown significant increases in benign and malignant lung tumors and lesions described as benign cystic keratinizing squamous-cell (KSC) tumors. CB-induced lung tumor formation, including KSC lesions, occurs only in rats. An expert panel reviewing KSC lesions (induced in rats by TiO2 or p-aramid) concluded that KSC lesions are not seen in humans. Lung tumors in humans are primarily located in the bronchial airways, whereas in the rat they occur in the parenchyma and are alveolar in origin. This species-specific response (tumor formation and KSC lesions) by the rat to CB, not seen in any other laboratory species and which has not been reported in humans, strongly suggests that the results of the rat inhalation bioassay should not be considered directly relevant when assessing human risk.

The widespread commercial and biomedical application of nanosilver include its use as a catalyst and an optical receptor in cosmetics, electronics and textile engineering, as a bactericidal agent, and in wound dressings, surgical instruments, and disinfectants. This, in turn, has increased the potential for interactions of AgNPs with terrestrial and aquatic environments, as well as potential exposure and toxicity to human health. In the present review, after giving an overview of ENMs, we discuss the current advances on the physiochemical properties of AgNPs with specific emphasis on biodistribution and both in vitro and in vivo toxicity following various routes of exposure. Most in vitro studies have demonstrated the size-, dose-and coating-dependent cellular uptake of AgNPs. Following NPs exposure, in vivo biodistribution studies have reported Ag accumulation and toxicity to local as well as distant organs.

Methods: MWCNTs were administered to mice and rats by intraperitoneal injection, intrascrotal injection, subcutaneous injection, intratracheal instillation and inhalation. Results: Intraperitoneal injection of MWNT-7 induced peritoneal mesothelioma in mice and rats. Intrascrotal injection induced peritoneal mesothelioma in rats. Intratracheal instillation of MWCNT-N (another straight fibrous MWCNT) induced both lung carcinoma and pleural mesothelioma in rats. In the whole body inhalation studies, in mice MWNT-7 promoted methylcholanthrene-initiated lung carcinogenesis. In rats, inhalation of MWNT-7 induced lung carcinoma and lung burdens of MWNT-7 increased with increasing concentration of airborne MWNT-7 and increasing duration of exposure. Conclusions: Straight, fibrous MWCNTs exerted carcinogenicity in experimental animals. Phagocytosis of MWCNT fibers by macrophages was very likely to be a principle factor in MWCNT lung carcinogenesis. Using no-observed-adverse-effect levelbased approach, we calculated that the occupational exposure limit (OEL) of MWNT-7 for cancer protection is 0.15 μg/m3 for a human worker. Further studies on the effects of the shape and size of MWCNT fibers and mode of action on the carcinogenicity are required.},

The wireless stress measurement system integrated with this sensor array is tested with compressive stress in the range from 0 MPa to 3 MPa for performance evaluation. Experimental results indicate that the fractional change in electrical resistance of the pressure-sensitive stress sensor changes linearly and reversibly with the compressive stress, and its fractional change goes up to 355% under uniaxial compression; the change rate of the electrical resistance can track the relaxation stress and give out a credible measurement in the process of stress relaxation. The relationship between input (compressive stress) and output (the fractional change in electrical resistance) of the pressure-sensitive sensor is ΔR/R0 = σ × 1.2 MPa-1. The wireless compressive stress measurement system can be used to achieve sensitivity of 1.33 V/MPa to the stress at stress resolution of 920.3 Pa.

	abstract     = {We introduce a strain-energy based nonlinear hyper-elastic formulation to model the material properties of ultrasoft dielectric elastomers over a wide range of elastic properties, prestretch, and thicknesses. We build on the uniaxial Gent formulation, and under the conditions of equi-biaxial strain, derive an expression for the bulge deformation versus pressure. A circular bulge test methodology is developed to experimentally measure the mechanical response of the silicone membranes. The Gent model captures both neo-Hookean and strain-stiffening behaviors, and gives predictions which are in agreement with experimental measurements. Membranes with different thinner fractions are characterized over nearly one order of magnitude variation in shear modulus. Stiffer membranes are observed to harden at lower stretch ratios due to the increased fraction of polymer chains in them. The present approach offers a simple and cost-effective procedure for characterizing soft membranes under commonly encountered biaxial deformation conditions. Soft elastomeric materials find applications in a variety of fields spanning from tissue engineering and soft robotics to targeted cell-culture and self-sensing devices. They form an essential ingredient in bio-inspired engineering today, owing to their resemblance to organic tissues, tunability of mechanical response, capacity for electrical actuation (dielectric), and stable and non-reactive properties 1-5. While there are numerous potential applications of highly compliant soft materials , an essential step in their effective usage is to quantify their elastic response over a range of strains. Material characterization studies have mostly focused on acrylic-based elastomers 6-10 , which display significant viscoelas-tic losses 4,11. In comparison, silicone-based dielectric elas-tomers have comparatively lower losses 4 , offer greater control of elasticity and are well-suited for in-house fabrication by combining a base mixture with a thinner component. They can attain very large strains before reaching yield point (hyperelasticity), with strain-stiffening occurring at large deformations 12-14. A number of hyper-elastic material models have been proposed in literature to model the non-linear response (stress vs. stretch-ratio) of soft materials. Among these, the Ogden 15 , Yeoh 16 and Arruda-Boyce 17 models all sufficiently capture the material behavior through complex multi-parameter fits. However, besides the shear modulus parameter, the remaining fitting constants bear uncertain physical significance. In comparison, the hyper-elastic Gent model 18 offers a simpler two-parameter constitutive relation composed of a shear modulus, G, and a locking parameter, J m. Importantly, J m is representative of the strain-stiffening behavior, which can, in principle, be deduced from molecular considerations of the degree of polymer cross-linking 19,20. While the Gent formulation has a few inherent limitations due to its two parameter fitting 21 , it has been subject to several improvements in recent years 22,23. Uniaxial tensile testing is the most widely used method for material characterization, owing to its simplicity and one-dimensional stretch condition. The testing is conducted in a) Electronic mail: kenneth_breuer@brown.edu b) Electronic mail: varghese_mathai@brown.edu a Universal Testing Machine (UTM) and requires careful preparation of a thin sample (dog-bone shaped) in order to avoid stress concentrations near the gripped region. For soft materials, these can be challenging as sliding near the grips and thinning due to clamping stresses can affect the quality of results 24,25. Furthermore, a number of assumptions are involved in translating the one-dimensional material response to commonly seen experimental conditions of plane or volumetric strains. A viable alternative is presented by the circular bulge method 26,27. Here, an applied differential pressure causes a thin material to enlarge under equi-biaxial stretch conditions. While traditionally employed for characterizing sheet metals and thin strips 28-30 , recently, it has begun to be considered for soft materials such as hydrogels and PDMS 31,32. The biaxial state of strain calls for a separate derivation of the stress vs. stretch-ratio relation. In this Letter, we study the non-linear deformations of silicone elastomer membranes subjected to equi-biaxial state of stretch. A constitutive relation is derived based on a two-parameter hyper-elastic formulation (Gent 18 model). We adopt a circular bulge test (CBT) methodology, with pressure control, to obtain the deformation vs. pressure of membranes with different prestretch and elastic moduli. The model's predictions are compared with experiments, and a series of validations are conducted. Following these, membranes with various thinner fractions are characterized, and their hyper-elastic parameters (shear modulus and locking parameter) are estimated.},

We present a novel approach for a set up and the experimental validation of an artificial pace maker that is able to drive basic robotic structures and act as artificial central pattern generator. The structure is based on multi-functional dielectric elastomers (DEs). DE actuators, DE switches and DE resistors are combined to create complex DE oscillators (DEOs). Supplied with only one external DC voltage, the DEO autonomously generates oscillating signals that can be used to clock a robotic structure, control the cyclic motion of artificial muscles in bionic robots or make a whole robotic structure move. We present the basic functionality, derive a mathematical model for predicting the generated signal waveform and verify the model experimentally.},

The electrode was directly screen printed using conductive CNT ink onto the PDMS. The capability of the sensor to distinguish between varying applied pressures were investigated based on its capacitive response. It was observed that the CNT-based pressure sensor produced an 8.2% change in capacitance when compared to the base capacitance, for a maximum detectable pressure of 337 kPa. A 0.021% change in capacitance per kPa and a correlation coefficient of 0.9971 was also determined for the CNT-based pressure sensor.

One of the most popular materials for force sensors in skins is carbon black (CB)/polydimethylsiloxane composite. To aid in skin design, a characterization of this composite is presented here. The sensitivity of composite resistance to uniaxial tension, compression, and shear for each CB concentration is measured and found to be similar for tension and compression, but smaller for shear, with resistance monotonically increasing with strain. In addition, under tension and compression the resistance of the material is measured both in line with and perpendicular to the axis of applied strain, and the response is found to be approximately equal in both cases. The electrical and mechanical relaxation time of the material is also measured and modeled for tension, compression, and shear. The mechanical relaxation time is found to be shorter than the electrical, with both increasing with CB concentration. However, the shortest mechanical relaxation time, 200 s, precludes a sensor with human-like response times without an active modeling and compensation system. Finally, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are measured and reported for each CB concentration. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2017, 134, 44773.},

This interest in wearable electronics, stretchable circuits, and flexible displays has created a demand for stable, easily manufactured, and cheap materials. However, the construction of flexible and elastic electronics, on which commercial electronic components can be mounted through simple and cost-effective processing, remains challenging. We have developed a nanocomposite of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer. To achieve uniform distributions of CNTs within the polymer, an optimized dispersion process was developed using isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and methyl-terminated PDMS in combination with ultrasonication. After vaporizing the IPA, various shapes and sizes can be easily created with the nanocomposite, depending on the mold. The material provides high flexibility, elasticity, and electrical conductivity without requiring a sandwich structure. It is also biocompatible and mechanically stable, as demonstrated by cytotoxicity assays and cyclic strain tests (over 10,000 times). We demonstrate the potential for the healthcare field through strain sensor, flexible electric circuits, and biopotential measurements such as EEG, ECG, and EMG. This simple and cost-effective fabrication method for CNT/PDMS composites provides a promising process and material for various applications of wearable electronics.},

Though rolled up from flat DEAs, they performed much poorer than the flat ones. Their electrically induced axial strains were previously reported as not more than 37.3%, while the flat ones produced greater than 100% strain. Often, the rolled DEAs succumb to premature breakdown before they can realize the full actuation potential like the flat ones do. This study shows that oil encapsulation, together with large hoop pre-stretch, helps single-wound rolled DEAs, which are also known as tubular DEAs, suppress premature breakdown. Consequently, the oil-encapsulated tubular DEAs can sustain higher electric fields, and thus produce larger isotonic strain and higher isometric stress change. Under isotonic testing, they sustained very high electric fields of up to 712.7 MV m-1, which is approximately 50% higher than those of the dry tubular DEAs. They produced up to 55.4% axial isotonic strain despite axially stiffening by the passive oil capsules. In addition, due to the use of large hoop pre-stretch, even the dry tubular DEAs without oil encapsulation achieved a very large axial strain of up to 84.2% compared to previous works. Under isometric testing, the oil-encapsulated tubular DEA with enhanced breakdown strength produced an axial stress change of up to nearly 0.6 MPa, which is 114% higher than that produced by the dry ones. In conclusion, the oil encapsulation and large pre-stretch help realize fuller actuation potential of tubular dielectric elastomer, which is subjected to initially non-uniform deformation.},

Characterisation of hydrogel properties and behaviour was achieved using UV spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), advancing contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and white light interferometry analyses. Results indicate that 3T3 fibroblast cells adhere and proliferate to confluence on hydrogels of <30 nm thickness similar to controls but cell attachment onto hydrogels of >30 nm was comparatively poor. Confluent cell sheets were harvested from the sub 30 nm ultra-thin hydrogels upon temperature reduction within 10 min.

In recent years, driven by the growing of the soft robotics and tissue-engineering research field, many biomimetic soft actuators and scaffolds were designed by taking inspiration from the biological skeletal muscle. In this work we used the electrospinning technique to develop a hierarchically arranged nanofibrous structure resembling the morphology and passive biomechanical properties of skeletal muscles. To mimic the passive properties of muscle, a low-modulus polyurethane was used. Several electrospun structures (mats, bundles, and a muscle-like assembly) were produced with different internal 3D arrangements of the nanofibers. A thermal characterization through thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry analysis investigated the physico-chemical properties of the material. The multiscale morphological similarities with the biological counterpart were verified by means of scanning electron microscopy investigation. The tensile tests on the different electrospun samples revealed that the muscle-like assembly presented slightly higher strength and stiffness compared to the skeletal muscle ones. Moreover, mathematical models of the mechanical behavior of the nanofibrous structures were successfully developed, allowing to better investigate the relationships between structure and mechanics of the samples. The promising results suggest the suitability of this hierarchical electrospun nanofibrous structure for applications in regenerative medicine and, if combined with active materials, in soft actuators for robotic.},

The monolayer electrode remains conductive up to 100% uniaxial strain. We present a method to fabricate DEAs using the LS transferred electrodes. By using a mask during the transfer step, the electrodes can be patterned with better than 200 μm resolution on both sides of a 1.4 μm-thick pre-stretched PDMS membrane to produce an ultra-low voltage DEA.

	abstract     = {The current requirements in automotive lubrication impose complex formulation. Among all the additives present in oil, the presence of molybdenum dithiocarbamate and zinc dithiophosphate, both tribological additives containing sulfur and phosphorous is found. For environmental reasons, it is important to reduce or eliminate the presence of these two elements contained in oil. Organic molecules based on carbon, oxygen and hydrogen seems to be good candidate. The lubrication mechanism of fatty acids (e.g. stearic, oleic and linoleic acids) is revisited with a new approach combining experimental and computational chemistry studies. First, the adsorption mechanisms of fatty acids on iron-based surfaces are investigated by Ultra-Accelerated Quantum Chemistry Molecular Dynamics simulations. The adsorption of fatty acids on iron oxide surface occurred through the acid group. Depending on the nature of the substrate, on the density of the film and on the tilt angle between the molecule and the surface, different adsorption mechanisms (physisorption and chemisorption) can occur. Stearic acid molecules form a close-packed and well-arranged monolayer whereas unsaturation acids cannot because of steric effects induced by double carbon-carbon bonds. The friction process favors the formation of carboxylate function. Results are confirmed by surface analysis (XPS and PM-IRRAS). Tribological properties of pure fatty acids, blended in PAO 4 and mixture of saturated/unsaturated acids are studied by MD simulations and tribotests. Low friction coefficient with no visible wear is reported for pure stearic acid and single stearic acid blended in PAO 4 at 1%w at high temperature. This lubricating behavior is inhibited in the presence of unsaturated acids, especially at 150 °C. MD simulation results show a faster diffusion toward the surface for unsaturated fatty acids than for stearic acid at all studied temperature.}

The building of polymeric thin films from vapor phase monomers is highly desirable for the surface modification of thermally sensitive substrates. The precise control of thin film thicknesses can be achieved using iCVD, creating a conformal coating on nano-, and micro-structured substrates such as membranes and microfluidics. iCVD allows for the deposition of polymer thin films of high chemical functionality, and thus, substrate surfaces can be functionalized directly from the iCVD polymer film or can selectively gain functionality through chemical reactions between functional groups on the substrate and other reactive molecules. These beneficial aspects of iCVD can spur breakthroughs in device fabrication based on the deposition of robust and functional polymer thin films. This review describes significant implications of and recent progress made in iCVD-based technologies in three fields: electronic devices, surface engineering, and biomedical applications.},

The fact that the coated resist already lost a significant amount of its solvent after spin coating, no time-consuming delays have to be kept before further process steps (handling, softbake). Limitations and disadvantages: In case of non-rotation-symmetric substrates, the resist forms a pronounced edge bead near the substrate edges due to the strong air turbulences. On textured substrate, the attained edge coverage of the textures is rather small, and parts of the topology might not be coated at all. With only few %, the resist yield is comparable low.},

TFD techniques have a unique advantage over other traditional surface modification methods (e.g., grafting) vis-à-vis their applicability to low-surface energy polymers, which usually resist modification through other techniques. TFD is also an economical approach to surface modification as inexpensive base materials can be functionalized with small amounts of more expensive active chemistries. Here, we review a range of TFD techniques and their applicability for the modification of polymeric membranes to improve durability and performance across water treatment applications. The discussed techniques include sputtering, thermal evaporation, chemical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition, electrochemical deposition, electron beam deposition, Langmuir-Blodgett deposition, and colloidal deposition. We review how recent developments in TFD techniques have made these methods a competitive alternative to other methods of membrane modification and discuss how modified membranes lead to improved performance for water applications, including microfiltration, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, and membrane distillation. Relative advantages of each coating process are discussed. We also discuss how process parameters for the various TFD techniques (deposition speed, versatility, conformality, thickness, bonding strength, temperature, etc.) influence the final chemical and physical properties of modified membranes. We conclude with an outlook for how further developments in TFD techniques will continue to introduce new possibilities for unique membrane properties and applications.},

Dielectric elastomer transducers (DETs) have attracted interest as actuators, sensors, and even as self-sensing actuators for applications in medicine, soft robotics, and microfluidics. To reach strains of more than 10 %, they currently require operating voltages of several hundred volts. In medical applications for artificial muscles, however, their operation is limited to a very few tens of volts, which implies high permittivity materials and thin-film structures. Such micro-or nanostructures can be prepared using electro-spraying, a cost-effective technique that allows upscaling using multiple nozzles for the fabrication of silicone films down to nanometer thickness. Deposition rates of several micrometers per hour have already been reached. It has been recently demonstrated that such membranes can be fabricated by electro-spraying and subsequent ultraviolet light irradiation. Herein, we introduce a relatively fast deposition of a dimethyl silicone copolymer fluid that contains mercaptopropyl side chains in addition to the methyl groups. Its elastic modulus was tuned with the irradiation dose of the 200 W Hg-Xe lamp. We also investigated the formation of elastomer films, using polymer concentrations in ethyl acetate of 1, 2, 5 and 10 vol%. After curing, the surface roughness was measured by means of atomic force microscopy. This instrument also enabled us to determine the average elastic modulus out of, for example, 400 nanoindentation measurements, using a spherical tip with a radius of 500 nm. The elastomer films were cured for a period of less than one minute, a speed that makes it feasible to combine electro-spraying and in situ curing in a single process step for fabricating low-voltage, multilayer DETs.},

In this work, we investigate the role of two polymer processing methods, spin coating and compression molding, in EMI shielding application. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) nanocomposites with multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) were spin-coated onto glass slides and compression-molded to a similar thickness. The processing method that exhibited the best shielding was employed to fabricate multiple PDMS composites comprising different compositions of MWCNT and Fe3O4 and stacked to form a multilayered EMI shielding PDMS composite. Scanning electron micrographs revealed that MWCNT in spin-coated composites are significantly more agglomerated than in the compression-molded film. Direct current conductivity and curing temperature were higher in compression-molded films as the filler formed a well-percolated network and hindered cross-linking of polymer chains. EMI shielding results revealed that spin-coated films demonstrated greater shielding effectiveness than compression-molded composites in the Ku-band (12-18 GHz). Individual agglomerates of MWCNT in spin-coated film attenuated incoming electromagnetic radiation more effectively than well-dispersed MWCNT in compression-molded films. Therefore, PDMS composites of different compositions of MWCNT and Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared through spin coating and stacked with a gradient of filler concentration, which resulted in maximum shielding of -28 dB, i.e., shielding more than 99% of incoming EM radiation by a 0.9 mm film.},

Actuators made from it show excellent activation properties including large strains (up to 380%), high energy densities (up to 3.4Jg-1), high efficiency, high responsive speed, good reliability and durability, etc. When a voltage is applied on the compliant electrodes of the dielectric elastomers, the polymer shrinks along the electric field and expands in the transverse plane. In this paper, a silicone dielectric elastomer is synthesized and the area strains are tested under different electric fields. Pre-strain and a certain driving electric field are applied to the film and the induced large strain by the Maxwell stress is measured. Barium titanate (BaTiO3) was incorporated into the silicone to fabricate a new dielectric elastomer: the experimental results show that the elastic modulus and dielectric constant were significantly improved. The experimental results coincide well with those of finite element analysis at a large deformation. Also, a theoretical analysis is performed on the coupling effects of the mechanical and electric fields. A nonlinear field theory of deformable dielectrics and hyperelastic theory are adopted to analyze the electromechanical field behavior of these actuators. Also the mechanical behavior of the dielectric elastomer undergoing large free deformation is studied. Finally, the constitutive model of a dielectric elastomer composite under free deformation and restrained deformation is derived. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

DEAs are driven by electric fields in the MV/m range and the dielectric elastomer itself is typically 3Oμm in thickness or more. Large operating voltages, in the order of several kilovolts, are then required to produce useful strains and these large voltages and the resulting electric fields could potentially pose problems when DEAs are used in close proximity to the human body. The fringing electric fields of a DEA in close association with the skin were modelled using finite element methods. The model was verified against a known analytic solution describing the electric field surrounding a capacitor in air. The agreement between the two is good, as the difference is less than 10% unless within 4.5mm of the DEAós lateral edges. As expected, it was found that for a DEA constructed with thinner dielectric layers, the fringe field strength dropped in direct proportion to the reduction in applied voltage, despite the internal field being maintained at the same level. More interestingly, modelling the electric field around stacked DEAs showed that for an even number of layers the electric field is an order of magnitude less than for an odd number of layers, due to the cancelling of opposing electric fields.}

In this work, the possibility of employing a suitable 3D printing technology for the development of one of the smart MR materials, the magnetorheological elastomer (MRE) has been explored. In order to achieve such 3D printing, a multi-material printing is implemented, where a controlled volume of MR fluid is encapsulated within an elastomer matrix in the layer-by-layer fashion. The choice of printing materials determines the final structure of the 3D printed hybrid MR elastomer. Printing with a vulcanizing MR suspension produces the solid MR structure inside the elastomer matrix while printing with a non-vulcanizing MR suspension (MR fluid) results in the structures that the MR fluid is encapsulated inside the elastomer matrix. The 3D printability of different materials has been studied by measuring their rheological properties and we found that the highly shear thinning and thixotropic properties are important for 3D printability. The quality of the printed filaments strongly depends on the key printing parameters such as extrusion pressure, initial height and feed rate. The experimental results from the forced vibration testing show that the 3D printed MR elastomers could change their elastic and damping properties when exposed to the external magnetic field. Furthermore, the 3D printed MR elastomer also exhibits the anisotropic behavior when the direction of the magnetic field is changed with respect to the orientation of the printed filaments. This study has demonstrated that the 3D printing is viable for fabrication of hybrid MR elastomers with controlled structures of magnetic particles or MR fluids.},

An inhomogeneous magnetic field gives rise to a reversible actuation effect, which is the result of the competition between magnetic and elastic forces in the material. Magnetorheological elastomers are capable of performing more pronounced deformations than known rigid actuator materials. In this article, the actuation behavior of magnetorheological elastomer ring-shaped bodies in a valve-type device for the control of an air flow is demonstrated. For this purpose, magnetorheological elastomer rings with different Shore hardness were prepared and used in the valve. In addition to the common isotropic magnetorheological elastomer samples, rings with an anisotropic arrangement of the magnetic particles were also prepared. The actuation of these anisotropic magnetorheological elastomers was compared with that of the isotropic samples. Based on simulations, the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field at the magnetorheological elastomer material which is required for the actuation could be strongly affected by the shape in the design of the magnetic yoke. In this study, the closing characteristics of the valve with different yoke shapes and magnetorheological elastomer materials were evaluated by measuring the dependence of the air flow rate on the magnetic field strength. It is demonstrated that the air flow through the valve can be controlled by the current in the field-generating coil, which yields the base for a new type of magnetic valve.},

This special composite geometry is known to enhance the mechanical response to the application of post-cured magnetic fields.

This manuscript introduces a toolkit to rapidly prototype, manufacture, test, and power various designs of hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators with muscle-like performance that achieve all three basic modes of actuation (expansion, contraction, and rotation). This toolkit utilizes easy-to-implement methods, inexpensive fabrication tools, commodity materials, and off-the-shelf high-voltage electronics thereby enabling a wide audience to explore HASEL technology. Remarkably, the actuators created from this easy-to-implement toolkit achieve linear strains exceeding 100%, a specific power greater than 150 W kg-1, and approx 20% strain at frequencies above 100 Hz. This combination of large strain, extreme speed, and high specific power yields soft actuators that jump without power-amplifying mechanisms. Additionally, an efficient fabrication technique is introduced for modular designs of HASEL actuators, which is used to develop soft robotic devices driven by portable electronics. Inspired by the versatility of elephant trunks, the above capabilities are combined to create an untethered continuum robot for grasping and manipulating delicate objects, highlighting the wide potential of the introduced methods for soft robots with increasing sophistication.},

These abilities are crucial in areas such as human-robot interaction. Soft robotic systems are currently limited by the soft actuators that power them. To date, most soft actuators are based on pneumatics or shape-memory alloys, which have issues with efficiency, response speed, and portability. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are controlled and powered electrically and excel with muscle-like actuation, but they typically require a rigid frame and prestretch to perform effectively. In addition, DEAs require complex stacks or structures to achieve linear contraction modes. We present a class of soft electrohydraulic transducers, termed Peano-HASEL (hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic) actuators, that combine the strengths of fluidic actuators and electrostatic actuators, while addressing many of their issues. These actuators use both electrostatic and hydraulic principles to linearly contract on application of voltage in a muscle-like fashion, without rigid frames, prestretch, or stacked configurations. We fabricated these actuators using a facile heat-sealing method with inexpensive commercially available materials. These prototypical devices demonstrated controllable linear contraction up to 10%, a strain rate of 900% per second, actuation at 50 hertz, and the ability to lift more than 200 times their weight. In addition, these actuators featured characteristics such as high optical transparency and the ability to self-sense their deformation state. Hence, this class of actuators demonstrates promise for applications such as active prostheses, medical and industrial automation, and autonomous robotic devices.},

	abstract     = {In a trend of the recent development of smart actuators, ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC) is considered as one of the new and innovative smart materials with superior advantages. The IPMC is suited to be utilized in medical micro robots and bio-inspired aquatic robotics. It is distinguished by nimble, soft, silent, flexible and lightweight properties. Furthermore, the driving voltage, which is being consumed, is fairly low, while the generated deflection is sufficiently large. In fact, for the IPMC actuator, hysteresis and creep properties are inevitable; and it is a great challenge to handle them and to achieve high-precision tracking in control design, especially when an internal morphology of system is complex and not fully understood. Therefore, this paper proposes a new model-free control approach for an underwater IPMC actuator to overcome the lack of its exact model and achieve an accurate micro-tracking trajectory. This approach is synthesized based on a nonlinear extended state observer (NESO) technique and a sliding mode controller (SMC), is added as an extra input to deal with the estimation error and drive the system. Finally, the proposed control is experimentally verified to show its benefits in comparison with a nonsingular terminal sliding mode (NTSM) controller. The experimental results indicate that the proposed controller is capable of delivering high-precision tracking and achieve high robustness.},

Herein, an electrically driven ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) artificial muscle with uniquely patterned electrodes for creating complex deformations is presented. The surface electrode pattern on the IPMC is created using a simple surface machining process. By selectively activating specific regions of the IPMC, bending, twisting, flapping, and other bioinspired locomotive behavior can be achieved. For instance, the bending and twisting response of an example 50 mm × 25 mm × 0.5 mm patterned IPMC actuator is characterized to determine its range of motion, output force and torque, as well as its effectiveness as a fish-fin-like propulsor. The experimental results show that the twisting angle exceeds 8° ; the blocking tip force and torque can be as high as 16.5 mN (at 3 V) and 0.83 • (at 4 V), respectively (driven at 0.05 Hz); and an average thrust force of approximately 0.4 mN (driven by 4-V sinusoidal input at 1 Hz) can be generated. These newly developed IPMC fins can be exploited to create novel and efficient propulsors for next-generation underwater robotic vehicles. An example bioinspired robotic fish is presented which exploits the capabilities of the patterned IPMCs for propulsion and maneuvering, where an average maximum swimming speed of approximately 28 mm/s is reported. © 1976-2012 IEEE.},

The deflection of this smart material results from several external factors, such as water distribution and concentration. IPMC strips with a variety of water concentration on the surfaces and the surface conductivity show various deflection patterns. In this paper, IPMC strips in four initial wetness conditions (100%, 50%, 0% wet on the anode surfaces but 100% wet on the cathode surfaces, and the last one submerged in deionized water) were tested. Even without any external excitation, the strips can bend due to nonuniform water distribution. In order to understand the effects of surface conductivity in an aquatic environment, an IPMC strip with two wires connected to two distinct spots was used to demonstrate the power loss due to the surface resistance. Three types of input signals, sawtooth, sinusoidal, and square waves, were used to compare the difference between the input and output signals measured at the two spots. Thick (1 mm) IPMC strips were fabricated and employed in this study to sustain and drive the robot with sufficient forces. Finally, an aquatic walking robot (102 × 80 × 43 mm, 39 g) with six 2-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) legs has been designed, implemented, andwalked in water at the speed of 0.5 mm/s. The average power consumption is 8 W per leg. Each leg has a thigh and a shank to generate 2-DOF motions.

Subsequently, the Pt thin layer growth on the treated Nafion membrane is performed by two methods (1) and (2). (1) Pt thin layer growth was carried out in the solution of [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2 and hydrazine mixture under pH=10 and 313 K. The resistance of Pt layer decreased with decreasing the concentration of hydrazine. (2) Pt layer growth on the Nafion membrane impregnating 1 M hydrazine was carried out in the [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2 solution under pH=10 and 333 K. The resistance of the Pt layer also decreases with increasing concentration of [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2.

Specifically, the unique actuation and sensing properties of ionic polymer-metal composites (IPMCs) are exploited in 3D printing to create electroactive polymer structures for application in soft robotics and bio-inspired systems. The process begins with extruding a precursor material (non-acid Nafion precursor resin) into a thermoplastic filament for 3D printing. The filament is then used by a custom-designed 3D printer to manufacture the desired soft polymer structures, layer by layer. Since at this stage the 3D-printed samples are not yet electroactive, a chemical functionalization process follows, consisting in hydrolyzing the precursor samples in an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide and dimethyl sulfoxide. Upon functionalization, metal electrodes are applied on the samples through an electroless plating process, which enables the 3D-printed IPMC structures to be controlled by voltage signals for actuation (or to act as sensors). This innovative AM process is described in detail and the performance of 3D printed IPMC actuators is compared to an IPMC actuator fabricated from commercially available Nafion sheet material. The experimental results show comparable performance between the two types of actuators, demonstrating the potential and feasibility of creating functional 3D-printed IPMCs.},

	abstract     = {Three chemical techniques to platinize the surface of a Nafion polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) to form a Pt/PEM electrode have been studied. The resulting Pt/PEM composites were characterized visually by transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy and electrochemically by (i) hydrogen adsorption to determine surface area, and (ii) the polarization characteristics for the oxidation of hydrogen. The Takenaka‐Torikai method was used in which a reductant diffuses through the membrane to contact and reduce platinic acid at the opposite face, and two variations of an impregnation‐reduction procedure were employed in which a cationic salt is first impregnated into the Nafion and subsequently the membrane is exposed to a reductant. A previously reported equilibrium impregnation method was modified such that the impregnation step was not carried to equilibrium and the concentration of the anionic reductant was significantly lowered. Upon judicious choice of the fabrication conditions, platinum deposited by the nonequilibrium impregnation ‐reduction procedure is concentrated in a thin (submicron), porous layer located predominantly within the membrane but near the surface where it is accessible to both gaseous reactants and a current collector. The metal distribution forms an electrode with a larger active surface area per unit weight of platinum and a better platinum utilization (mA/mg Pt for the hydrogen oxidation reaction) compared to Pt/PEM electrode prepared by the equilibrium impregnation‐reduction process or the Takenaka‐Torikai method. The chemical and physical processes which occur to affect the metal film formed in all three techniques are discussed.},

	abstract     = {This contribution demonstrates the fabrication process of dielectric elastomer transducers (DETs). DETs are stretchable capacitors consisting of an elastomeric dielectric membrane sandwiched between two compliant electrodes. The large actuation strains of these transducers when used as actuators (over 300% area strain) and their soft and compliant nature has been exploited for a wide range of applications, including electrically tunable optics, haptic feedback devices, wave-energy harvesting, deformable cell-culture devices, compliant grippers, and propulsion of a bioinspired fish-like airship. In most cases, DETs are made with a commercial proprietary acrylic elastomer and with hand-applied electrodes of carbon powder or carbon grease. This combination leads to non-reproducible and slow actuators exhibiting viscoelastic creep and a short lifetime. We present here a complete process flow for the reproducible fabrication of DETs based on thin elastomeric silicone films, including casting of thin silicone membranes, membrane release and prestretching, patterning of robust compliant electrodes, assembly and testing. The membranes are cast on flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates coated with a water-soluble sacrificial layer for ease of release. The electrodes consist of carbon black particles dispersed into a silicone matrix and patterned using a stamping technique, which leads to preciselydefined compliant electrodes that present a high adhesion to the dielectric membrane on which they are applied.},

	abstract     = {The dielectric permittivity of a polymeric material can be significantly increased when blended with conductive fillers at concentrations approaching the percolation threshold. However, reproducible synthesis of such composites is after decades of research still a major challenge and a bottleneck for their application. Difficulties arise in controlling the size and shape of the filler as well as in its homogenous distribution within the composite. These parameters strongly affect the dielectric as well as mechanical properties of the composite. While a substantial amount of literature deals with the influence of conductive fillers on the dielectric properties of composites, little is known about their mechanical properties. It is therefore still an important goal to synthesize materials with simultaneously high permittivity and good mechanical properties. Here, we report the synthesis of dielectric elastomers that combine key properties such as high flexibility and stretchability, high thermal stability, increased permittivity, low dielectric loss and conductivity. Such materials were prepared by solution processing using quasi-spherical silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) of a defined size in a polydimethylsiloxane matrix (Mw = 692 kDa). To prevent percolation, the AgNPs were coated with a thin silica shell (<4 nm). To increase their compatibility with the silicone matrix, these core-shell nanoparticles were passivated with a silane reagent. The insulating silica shell around the particles precisely defines the minimum approach distance between the cores as twice the shell thickness. The dielectric properties of the passivated particles (filler) were measured in pellets and found to have an almost frequency independent value of permittivity = 90 and a very low loss factor tan (sigma) = 0.023 at high frequencies. When such particles were used as fillers in a polydimethylsiloxane matrix, composites with low dielectric losses were obtained. A composite containing a 31 vol% filler with permittivity = 21 and tan (sigma) = 0.03 at ∼1 kHz was achieved. At a AgNP volume fraction of 20%, the composite has permittivity = 5.9 at ∼1 kHz, a dielectric strength of 13.4 V um−1, an elastic modulus as low as 350 kPa at 100% strain, and a strain at break of 800%. Due to the high specific energy density per volume at low electric fields, these composites are attractive materials in applications involving low electric fields.},

The conical configuration has been widely adopted in DEA applications such as bio-inspired locomotion and micropumps for its good compactness, ease for fabrication and large actuation stroke. However, the conical protrusion of the DEA membrane is characterized by inhomogeneous stresses, which complicate their design. In this work, we present an analytical model-based optimization for conical DEAs with the three biasing elements: (I) linear compression spring; (II) biasing mass; and (III) antagonistic double-cone DEA. The optimization is to find the maximum stroke and work output of a conical DEA by tuning its geometry (inner disk to outer frame radius ratio a/b) and pre-stretch ratio. The results show that (a) for all three cases, stroke and work output are maximum for a pre-stretch ratio of 1 × 1 for the Parker silicone elastomer, which suggests the stretch caused by out-of-plane deformation is sufficient for this specific elastomer. (b) Stroke maximization is obtained for a lower a/b ratio while a larger a/b ratio is required to maximize work output, but the optimal a/b ratio is less than 0.3 in all three cases. (c) The double-cone configuration has the largest stroke while single cone with a biasing mass has the highest work output.},

In addition, additive manufacturing can allow DEAs with complex geometric configurations to be realized. This study investigates analytical approaches to optimize the performance of helical dielectric elastomer actuator (HDEA) based on additive manufacturing technologies. Optimized geometric configurations tailored to additive manufacturing and proper material selection for elastomer and electrode can improve the overall performance of HDEA. Due to the absence of pre-stretch in the elastomer membranes with additive manufacturing, associated drawbacks, such as electromechanical instability, high external voltage requirement, and their alternate solutions are analyzed and discussed. The performance of HDEA are evaluated by displacement, block force, and weight-to-force ratio by varying multiple geometric parameters including membrane thickness, pitch angle, inner-toouter electrode ratio, and actuation voltage. Since the selection of materials is as important as the geometric parameters of the actuator, printable elastomer and electrode materials with dielectric and mechanical properties for HDEA are evaluated. By optimizing geometric parameters and selecting appropriate materials based on its properties, appropriate manufacturing techniques are discussed to print both dielectric elastomer and electrode layers.},

	abstract     = {Electrical actuators were made from firms of dielectric elastomers (such as silicones) coated on both sides with compliant electrode material. When voltage was applied, the resulting electrostatic forces compressed the film in thickness and expanded it in area, producing strains up to 30 to 40%. It is now shown that prestraining the film further improves the performance of these devices. Actuated strains up to 117% were demonstrated with silicone elastomers, and up to 215% with acrylic elastomers using biaxially and uniaxially prestrained films. The strain, pressure, and response time of silicone exceeded those of natural muscle; specific energy densities greatly exceeded those of other field-actuated materials. Because the actuation mechanism is faster than in other high-strain electroactive polymers, this technology may be suitable for diverse applications.},

When less than a centimeter, they belong to an even more special subcategory of robots or devices, in that they often lack on-board power, sensing, computation, and control. Soft, active materials are particularly well suited for this task, with a wide range of stimulants and a number of impressive examples, demonstrating large deformations, high motion complexities, and varied multifunctionality.

	abstract     = {Natural muscle is a spectacular actuator. Why? After millions of years, nature has evolved actuators that allow breathtaking performances. Cheetahs can run, dolphins can swim, and flies can fly like no artificial technology can. It is often argued that if human technology could mimic muscle, then biological-like performance would follow. Unfortunately, the blind copying or mimicking of a part of nature [Ritzmann et al., 2000] does not often lead to the best design, for a host of reasons [Vogel, 1998]. Evolution works on the "just good enough" principle. Optimal designs are not the necessary end product of evolution. Multiple satisfactory solutions can result in similar performances. Animals do bring to our attention amazing designs, but these designs carry with them the baggage of their history. Why should these historical vestiges be incorporated into an artificial technology? Moreover, muscle design is constrained by factors that may have no relationship to human-engineered designs. Muscles must be able to grow over time, but still function along the way. Muscles remain plastic in adulthood and can self-repair. Muscles are intimately tied to pressure in the fluid system that supports them. Muscles are involved in metabolic regulation and can even serve as a source of fuel in starvation. Finally, muscles are obviously not the only part of an animal that makes spectacular performances possible. We must understand what muscle uniquely contributes to an integrated, tuned system that includes multiple muscles, joints and sensors, a transport system for fuel delivery, and a complex control system, all of which functions through skeletal scaffolding. To design an artificial muscle is a worthy endeavor. However, we strongly urge that nature's technologies provide biological inspiration for artificial technologies. Biological inspiration should involve the transfer of principles or lessons discovered in a diversity of animals. Our knowledge of biological muscle should be able to assist us in the construction of an actuator with desired performance capacities only observed in animals. However, the performance of biological actuators should not be and has not been the single design by which we measure our success. We have and will continue to design human-made actuators that exceed natural muscle in performance in particular metrics and for specific tasks. If we are to call a human-made actuator an artificial muscle, we must detail precisely the tasks that uniquely define what muscles do. Metrics can best be compared under common conditions. To develop these appropriate tests is an ongoing challenge, because we are still discovering how muscles work in animals. Moreover, engineers have a multitude of metrics that have made relevant, direct comparisons nearly impossible. The design of an artificial muscle will require novel interdisciplinary collaborations between muscle biologists and engineers. Biologists can provide inspiration and detail about what is known at present, but engineers can reciprocate with quantitative hypotheses and novel instrumentation that will lead to new tests and discoveries of muscle function.},

This study evaluates the relationship of the total energy intake to basal metabolic rate ratio (EI/BMR) and physical activity (PA) with sarcopenia. A second aim was to analyze the interaction between EI/BMR and PA by sex and age. We analyzed 16,313 subjects aged ≥ 19 years who had dual‒energy X-ray absorptiometry data. Sarcopenia was defined as appendicular lean mass/weight (%) that was 1 standard deviation below the sex-specific mean value for a young reference group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine the interaction between EI/BMR and PA. In this study, as EI/BMR increased, the risk of sarcopenia decreased, particularly in the older groups. Both high PA and high EI/BMR were independently related to the reduced risk of sarcopenia and showed additive effects on reducing the risk in young male and older groups. However, high PA was associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia in the young female group with low energy intake. Our findings suggest that an adequate balance between energy intake and PA is related to a low risk of sarcopenia, especially in young females.},

The time-dependent change of resistance under constant stress or strain was found to be the succession of the previous pressure-dependent piezoresistance. Depending on the filler volume fraction and the level of the constant stress or strain, resistance creep and resistance relaxation with different directions were observed. An empirical expression similar to the Burgers equation could be applied to fit the data for both the resistance creep and the resistance relaxation. The fitted relaxation time as a function of pressure showed that there exist two competing processes controlling the piezoresistive behavior and its time dependence. Mechanical creep and stress relaxation of the composites were also studied, and a comparison with the time-dependent resistance implied that there is a conducting percolation network attributed to the physical contacts between SCF and a mechanical network formed by the molecular entanglement or physical crosslinking of the polymer matrix and the interaction between the filler and the matrix. It is believed that the two networks dominate the electrical and the mechanical behaviors, respectively. © 2004 Materials Research Society.},

The force and displacement generated by such actuators have been studied as a function of applied electric field under different prestrained conditions. In order to introduce anisotropy in the fiber behavior, two types of prestrains (uniaxial and uniform) were applied. Actuation strains of 7 and 18% were recorded for silicone tubes in the axial and radial directions, respectively. Polyurethane tubes produced significantly higher blocking force compared to silicone tubes. The results demonstrate significant influence of applied prestrain on actuation strains and blocking force measured under isometric condition.},

To interact with their environment, soft robots require artificial muscles to actuate movement. These artificial muscles need to be as strong, fast, and robust as their natural counterparts. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are promising soft transducers, but typically exhibit low output forces and low energy densities when used without rigid supports. Here, we report a soft composite DEA made of strain-stiffening elastomers and carbon nanotube electrodes, which demonstrates a peak energy density of 19.8 J/kg. The result is close to the upper limit for natural muscle (0.4-40 J/kg), making these DEAs the highest-performance electrically driven soft artificial muscles demonstrated to date. To obtain high forces and displacements, we used low-density, ultrathin carbon nanotube electrodes which can sustain applied electric fields upward of 100 V/um without suffering from dielectric breakdown. Potential applications include prosthetics, surgical robots, and wearable devices, as well as soft robots capable of locomotion and manipulation in natural or human-centric environments.},

	abstract     = {Dielectric elastomers have demonstrated tremendous potential as high-strain electromechanical transducers for a myriad of novel applications across all engineering disciplines. Because their soft, viscoelastic mechanical properties are similar to those of living tissues, dielectric elastomers have garnered a strong foothold in a plethora of biomedical and biomimetic applications. Dielectric elastomers consist of a sheet of stretched rubber, or elastomer, coated on both sides with compliant electrode materials; application of a voltage generates an electrostatic pressure that deforms the elastomer. They can function as soft generators, sensors, or actuators, and this last function is the focus of this dissertation. Many design configurations are possible, such as stacks, minimum energy structures, interpenetrating polymer networks, shape memory dielectric elastomers, and others; dielectric elastomers are already being applied to many fields of biomedicine.The first part of the original research presented in this dissertation details a PDMS microfluidic system paired with a dielectric elastomer stack actuator of anisotropically prestrained VHB(TM) 4910 (3M(TM)) and single-walled carbon nanotubes. These electroactive microfluidic devices demonstrated active increases in microchannel width when 3 and 4 kV were applied. Fluorescence microscopy also indicated an accompanying increase in channel depth with actuation. The cross-sectional area strains at 3 and 4 kV were approximately 2.9% and 7.4%, respectively. The device was then interfaced with a syringe  pump, and the pressure was measured upstream. Linear pressure-flow plots were developed, which showed decreasing fluidic resistance with actuation, from 0.192 psi/(microL/min) at 0 kV, to 0.160 and 0.157 psi/(microL/min) at 3 and 4 kV, respectively. This corresponds to an ~18% drop in fluidic resistance at 4 kV. Active de-clogging was tested in situ with the device by introducing ~50 µm diameter PDMS microbeads and other smaller particulate debris into the system. After a channel blockage was confirmed, three actuation attempts successfully cleared the blockage. Further tests indicated that the device were biocompatible with HeLa cells at 3 kV. To our knowledge this is the first pairing of dielectric elastomers with microfluidics in a non-electroosmotic context. Applications may include adaptive microfilters, micro-peristaltic pumps, and reduced-complexity lab-on-a-chip devices.Dielectric elastomers can also be adapted to manipulate fluidic systems on a larger scale. The second part of the dissertation research reports a novel low-profile, biomimetic dielectric elastomer tubular actuator capable of actively controlling hydraulic flow. The tubular actuator has been established as a reliable tunable valve, pinching a secondary silicone tube completely shut in the absence of a fluidic pressure bias or voltage, offering a high degree of resistance against fluidic flow, and able to open and completely remove this resistance to flow with an applied low power actuation voltage. The system demonstrates a rise in pressure of ~3.0 kPa when the dielectric elastomer valve is in the passive, unactuated state, and there is a quadratic fall in this pressure with increasing actuation voltage, until ~0 kPa is reached at 2.4 kV. The device is reliable for at least 2,000 actuation cycles for voltages at or below 2.2 kV. Furthermore, modeling of the actuator and fluidic system yields results consistent with the observed experimental dependence of intrasystem pressure on input flow rate, actuator prestretch, and actuation voltage. To our knowledge, this is the first actuator of its type that can control fluid flow by directly actuating the walls of a tube. Potential applications may include an implantable artificial sphincter, part of a peristaltic pump, or a computerized valve for fluidic or pneumatic control.The final part of the dissertation presents a novel dielectric elastomer band with integrated rigid elements for the treatment of chronic acid reflux disorders. This dielectric elastomer ring actuator consists of a two-layer stack of prestretched VHB(TM) 4905 with SWCNT electrodes. Its transverse prestretch was maintained by selective rigidification of the VHB(TM) using a UV-curable, solution-processable polymer network. The actuator exhibited a maximum vertical (circumferential) actuation strain of 25% at 3.4 kV in an 24.5 g weighted isotonic setup. It also exhibited the required passive force of 0.25 N and showed a maximum force drop of 0.11 N at 3.32 kV during isometric tests at 4.5 cm. Modeling was performed to determine the prestretches necessary to achieve maximum strain while simultaneously exerting the force of 0.25 N, which corresponds to a required pinching pressure of 3.35 kPa. Modeling also determined the spacing between and number of rigid elements required. The theoretical model curves were adjusted to account for the passive rigid elements, as well as for the addition of margins; the resulting plots agrees well with experiment. The performance of the DE band is comparable to that of living muscle, and this is the first application of dielectric elastomer actuators in the design of a medical implant for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. Related applications that could result from this technology are very low-profile linear peristaltic pumps, artificial intestines, an artificial urethra, and artificial blood vessels.},

	abstract     = {Micrometer-thin polymer films are often prepared using spin coating. In applications such as low-voltage dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs), however, nanometer-thin polymer layers are required. In this paper, it is demonstrated that alternating current electrospray deposition allows for the fabrication of high-quality nanometer-thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films. The growth of the PDMS with an average molecular weight of 6000 g mol−1 at rates of 0.02–5.54 nm s−1 was in situ monitored by means of spectroscopic ellipsometry. The Cauchy layer model performs above a deposition-rate-dependent average film thickness, which is associated with a confluent film. The droplet size measurements as the function of deposition rate show that inertia and polarization forces dominate in liquid PDMS electrospraying. The roughness of the deposited films increases with the spray rate. After UV-light curing under Ar atmosphere, however, the films smoothen to root-mean-square roughness values between 0.20 and 0.28 nm determined by atomic force microscopy on areas of 5 μm × 5 μm and between 2 and 20 nm determined by interferometry on an area of 0.72 mm2. Such electrosprayed PDMS films with (sub-)nanometer roughness qualify for the fabrication of low-voltage DEAs.},

	abstract     = {The effect of crossing and of different types of mutations (or genetic control) on the speed of selective adaptation has been investigated by data processing machines. The procedure is based on the use of self-reproducing numeric patterns, or arrays of numbers and/or single bits of information. Each number or bit was used to identify a property of the pattern, which could be subject to selection. Some of the properties represented crossing, mutation or reproductive characteristics of the pattern. Some other properties represented other characteristics essential for the pattern's ability to survive and reproduce, for example, by identifying the pattern's strategy in a game of poker used as a means to select the patterns to be reproduced. A measure of the speed of improvement as a function of generation number has been defined and used to compare the improvement under various conditions. The results obtained can be summarized as follows: under conditions simulating regular Mendelian (non-polygenic nor quantitative) inheritance, crossing greatly enhances the speed of selective adaptation, particularly if interaction between the expressions of different hereditary factors is avoided; under conditions simulating polygenic control of quantitative characters, crossing does not enhance the speed of selective adaptation. Furthermore, in a period of rapid selective adaptation the ability to interbreed spreads rapidly in the population as a positively selected characteristic when conditions simulating regular Mendelian inheritance are used. On the other hand, the breeding characteristic spreads less rapidly or not at all under conditions simulating quantitative characters under polygenic control. In the simple game arrangements used in our adaptive selection experiments, the patterns were very often able to develop an optimum game strategy. However, in some instances a "selective instability" characterized by statistical fluctuations preventing the achievement of an optimum game strategy was developed. Selective instability, if not properly controlled, is likely to assume larger proportions in experiments of a more complicated nature, and may constitute a serious problem for the practical applications of adaptive selection methods by data processing machines. © 1967.},

Two boundary conditions are examined - traction free boundaries and a fixed outer radius. The advantages and limitations of each boundary conditions are discussed. It is shown that dielectric tubes subjected to traction free boundaries experience instabilities, an effect that can be avoided by fixing the outer surface. Next, the electromechanical behavior of a stacked cylindrical actuator comprised of dielectric tubes that are mechanically connected in series and electrically connected in parallel is determined under the two boundary conditions discussed above. It is shown that the stacking of cylindrical layers increases the range of available inner radii at the cost of design limitations. Interestingly, it is found that mounting layers on a stacked cylindrical actuator may lead to instabilities even if the outer radius is fixed.},

To improve the performance of these multilayer actuators we present two different ways.  To reduce the driving voltage it is desirable to fabricate dielec. films with a thickness below 20 μm.  This can be achieved by high speed spin coating of an uncured elastomer.  Analyzing the automated process reveals nine principal process parameters.  An adequate design of expt. reduces the no. of necessary tests to an acceptable value.  With these results we are able to spin thin films with a thickness of less than 5 μm and a thickness variation of about 3%.  Secondly, we examine the influence of nanosized particles of metal oxide powder on the permittivity of the elastomer film.  Three different materials, namely aluminiumoxide, titaniumdioxide and bariumtitanate with a bulk permittivity of about 10, 100, 1000, resp., are used to increase the overall permittivity of the composite.

	abstract     = {Hierarchical actuators are comprised of multiple individual actuator elements arranged into a system, resulting in improved and expanded performance. Natural muscle tissue is a complex and multi-level example of hierarchical actuation, with its hierarchy spanning from the micrometer to the centimeter scale. In addition to a hierarchical configuration, muscle tissue exists in varying geometric arrangements. Pennate muscle tissue, denoted by its characteristic fibers extending obliquely away from the muscle tissue line of action, leverages geometric complexity to transform the relationship between fiber inputs and muscle tissue outputs. In this paper, a bioinspired hierarchical pennate actuator is detailed. This work expands on previous pennate actuator studies by deriving constitutive force, contraction, and stiffness models for a general pennate actuator, where the constituent fibers can be constructed from any linear actuator. These models are experimentally validated by studying a pennate actuator with McKibben artificial muscles constituting the actuator fibers. McKibben artificial muscles are used because they have a high force-to-weight ratio and are inexpensive to construct, making them an attractive candidate for hierarchical actuators and mobile robotics. Using the derived constitutive models, general pennate actuator performance is better understood by analyzing the transmission ratio, blocked force, and free contraction. Loaded contractions and stiffness during isotonic and isobaric contractions are also explored. The results allow for informed design decisions and an understanding of the associated tradeoffs when recreating the remarkable properties of pennate musculature. Future work will leverage the results of this paper to create an adaptive pennate actuator that is capable of changing configuration in response to force, contraction and stiffness demands.},

	abstract     = {Fatigue from voluntary muscular effort is a complex phenomenon involving the central nervous system (CNS) and muscle. An understanding of the mechanisms within muscle that cause fatigue has led to the development of nutritional strategies to enhance performance. Until recently, little was known about CNS mechanisms of fatigue, even though the inability or unwillingness to generate and maintain central activation of muscle is the most likely explanation of fatigue for most people during normal daily activities. A possible role of nutrition in central fatigue is receiving more attention with the development of theories that provide a clue to its biological mechanisms. The focus is on the neurotransmitter serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] because of its role in depression, sensory perception, sleepiness, and mood. Nutritional strategies have been designed to alter the metabolism of brain 5-HT by affecting the availability of its amino acid precursor. Increases in brain 5-HT concentration and overall activity have been associated with increased physical and perhaps mental fatigue during endurance exercise. Carbohydrate (CHO) or branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) feedings may attenuate increases in 5-HT and improve performance. However, it is difficult to distinguish between the effects of CHO on the brain and those on the muscles themselves, and most studies involving BCAA show no performance benefits. It appears that important relations exist between brain 5-HT and central fatigue. Good theoretical rationale and data exist to support a beneficial role of CHO and BCAA on brain 5-HT and central fatigue, but the strength of evidence is presently weak.},

	abstract     = {© 2016 SPIE. Fecal incontinence is the involuntary loss of bowel content and affects more than 12% of the adult population, including 45% of retirement home residents. Severe fecal incontinence is often treated by implanting an artificial sphincter. Currently available implants, however, have long-term reoperation rates of 95% and definitive explantation rates of 40%. These statistics show that the implants fail to reproduce the capabilities of the natural sphincter and that the development of an adaptive, biologically inspired implant is required. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEA) are being developed as artificial muscles for a biomimetic sphincter, due to their suitable response time, reaction forces, and energy consumption. However, at present the operation voltage of DEAs is too high for artificial muscles implanted in the human body. To reduce the operating voltage to tens of volts, we are using microfabrication to reduce the thickness of the elastomer layer to the nanometer level. Two microfabrication methods are being investigated: molecular beam deposition and electrospray deposition. This communication covers the current status and a perspective on the way forward, including the long-term prospects of constructing a smart sphincter from low-voltage sensors and actuators based on nanometer-thin dielectric elastomer films. As DEA can also provide sensory feedback, a biomimetic sphincter can be designed in accordance with the geometrical and mechanical parameters of its natural counterpart. The availability of such technology will enable fast pressure adaption comparable to the natural feedback mechanism, so that tissue atrophy and erosion can be avoided while maintaining continence du ring daily activities.}

For polydimethylsiloxane, fillers or functionalized crosslinkers have been incorporated into the elastomer to improve dielectric properties. To produce elastomer layers nanometers thin, molecular beam deposition was introduced. We pursue the synthesis of a high-permittivity oligomer, namely a chloropropyl-functional, vinyl-terminated siloxane to be thermally evaporated and subsequent UV curing to form an elastomer. The synthesized oligomer exhibits dielectric permittivity enhanced by 33% and a breakdown increase of 26% with respect to the commercially available oligomer DMS-V05. Films 160 nm thin were fabricated after being evaporated under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Spectroscopic ellipsometery served for film growth monitoring. Using atomic force microscopy, the film surface morphology and mechanics were characterized after growth termination and subsequent curing. The Young's modulus of the elastomer corresponded to (1.8 ± 0.2) MPa and is thus a factor of two lower than that of DMS-V05. Consequently, the properties of the films prepared by the new elastomer can be quantified by the normalized figure of merit, which estimates to 4.6. The presented approach is an essential step toward the realization of low-voltage DEA for medical applications and beyond.},

Coiled fibers recently emerged as attractive candidates for these purposes, owing to their simple construction and the possibility of their thermal, electrical and chemical actuation. An intuitive theoretical understanding of the mechanics of actuation of these muscles is essential for the enhancement of their performance and can pave the way for the development of new applications and technologies. In this paper, a complete theoretical model for the tensile actuation of fiber reinforced artificial muscles is presented and experimentally validated. The model demonstrates that all muscles made from the same material have a universal behavior, which can be described by a single master curve. It enables the systematic design and understanding of coiled muscles for specific performance owing to a comprehensive mathematical correlation among the geometry, materials properties, and actuation. Carbon fibers (CF)/polydimethylsiloxane coiled muscles are demonstrated as simple to fabricate yet powerful muscles owing to the availability of high strength CF. In addition to showing excellent agreement with the theoretical models, they can be actuated by joule heating or chemical swelling, lift up to 12 600 times their own weight, support up to 60 MPa of mechanical stress, provide tensile strokes higher than 25%, and a specific work up to 758 J kg −1 , the latter is more than 18 times higher than that of natural muscles.

	abstract     = {BACKGROUND - Angiotensin II (Ang II) has been reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of various human diseases including atherosclerosis, and inhibition of Ang II activity has been shown to reduce the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases. We have previously demonstrated that vascular cell senescence contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis; however, the effects of Ang II on vascular cell senescence have not been examined. METHODS AND RESULTS - Ang II significantly induced premature senescence of human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) via the p53/p21-dependent pathway in vitro. Inhibition of this pathway effectively suppressed induction of proinflammatory cytokines and premature senescence of VSMCs by Ang II. Ang II also significantly increased the number of senescent VSMCs and induced the expression of proinflammatory molecules and of p21 in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. Loss of p21 markedly ameliorated the induction of proinflammatory molecules by Ang II, thereby preventing the development of atherosclerosis. Replacement of p21-deficient bone marrow cells with wild-type cells had little influence on the protective effect of p21 deficiency against the progression of atherogenesis induced by Ang II. CONCLUSIONS - We demonstrated that Ang II promotes vascular inflammation by inducing premature senescence of VSMCs both in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest a critical role of p21-dependent premature senescence of VSMCs in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. © 2006 American Heart Association, Inc.},

The definition that emerged is: "cachexia, is a complex metabolic syndrome associated with underlying illness and characterized by loss of muscle with or without loss of fat mass. The prominent clinical feature of cachexia is weight loss in adults (corrected for fluid retention) or growth failure in children (excluding endocrine disorders). Anorexia, inflammation, insulin resistance and increased muscle protein breakdown are frequently associated with cachexia. Cachexia is distinct from starvation, age-related loss of muscle mass, primary depression, malabsorption and hyperthyroidism and is associated with increased morbidity.

They have been incorporated into a wide variety of devices, such as microfluidic systems, cell bioreactors, tunable optics, haptic displays, and actuators for soft robotics. Fabrication of DEA devices is complex, and the majority are inefficiently made by hand. 3D printing offers an automated and flexible manufacturing alternative that can fabricate complex, multi-material, integrated devices consistently and in high resolution. We present a novel additive manufacturing approach to DEA devices in which five commercially available, thermal and UV-cure DEA silicone rubber materials have been 3D printed with a drop-on-demand, piezoelectric inkjet system. Using this process, 3D structures and high-quality silicone dielectric elastomer membranes as thin as 2 μm have been printed that exhibit mechanical and actuation performance at least as good as conventionally blade-cast membranes. Printed silicone membranes exhibited maximum tensile strains of up to 727%, and DEAs with printed silicone dielectrics were actuated up to 6.1% area strain at a breakdown strength of 84 V μm-1 and also up to 130 V μm-1 at 2.4% strain. This approach holds great potential to manufacture reliable, high-performance DEA devices with high throughput.},

	abstract     = {Much of recent machine learning has focused on deep learning, in which neural network weights are trained through variants of stochastic gradient descent. An alternative approach comes from the field of neuroevolution, which harnesses evolutionary algorithms to optimize neural networks, inspired by the fact that natural brains themselves are the products of an evolutionary process. Neuroevolution enables important capabilities that are typically unavailable to gradient-based approaches, including learning neural network building blocks (for example activation functions), hyperparameters, architectures and even the algorithms for learning themselves. Neuroevolution also differs from deep learning (and deep reinforcement learning) by maintaining a population of solutions during search, enabling extreme exploration and massive parallelization. Finally, because neuroevolution research has (until recently) developed largely in isolation from gradient-based neural network research, it has developed many unique and effective techniques that should be effective in other machine learning areas too. This Review looks at several key aspects of modern neuroevolution, including large-scale computing, the benefits of novelty and diversity, the power of indirect encoding, and the field’s contributions to meta-learning and architecture search. Our hope is to inspire renewed interest in the field as it meets the potential of the increasing computation available today, to highlight how many of its ideas can provide an exciting resource for inspiration and hybridization to the deep learning, deep reinforcement learning and machine learning communities, and to explain how neuroevolution could prove to be a critical tool in the long-term pursuit of artificial general intelligence.},

This paper proposes a new design of homogeneous flexible and stretchable robot skin based on carbon-black-filled (CBF) silicone and conductive fabric that can sense multiple contact locations as well as applied pressure. CBF silicone has been already used in sensing technology but its piezoresistivity is still largely misunderstood. This particular behavior is investigated in this paper through a set of experiments conducted on isolated sensing cells. Using the results of these experiments, a model describing the variation of the resistivity in the CBF silicone as a function of the applied pressure is proposed. Based on this model, a simple way to accurately estimate the applied pressure in real time is demonstrated. Finally, using this improved knowledge of the behaviour of the CBF silicone, the fabrication of a fully functional sensor array is presented. The proposed design has the particularity of circumventing the well-known problem of cross-talk between sensing cells.},

With molecular weights of 6000 and 28,000 g/mol, vinyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was evaporated under high-vacuum conditions at crucible temperatures between 100 and 180 °C. Both deposition rate and realizable film thickness showed linear dependency with respect to the crucible temperature and were significantly higher for PDMS with lower molecular weight. Optimized growth conditions for 6000 g/mol were obtained at 180 °C with a deposition rate of (130 ± 5) nm per hour and a maximal film thickness of (530 ± 1) nm. Thermally induced polymerization was observed to limit the maximum accessible evaporation temperature for hydride-terminated PDMS above 180 °C and for vinyl-terminated PDMS above 230 °C. Ultraviolet (UV) light induced polymerization of vinyl-terminated PDMS was successfully established via radicalization at the functional vinyl end groups of the chains. Atomic force microscopy nanoindentation of the UV-polymerized network reveals that the oligomer chain length determines the elastic modulus of the polymer layer. Manufactured as asymmetric cantilever structures, the bending characteristic gave evidence that a 200 nm-thin film, activated in the voltage range between 1 and 12 V, maintains the actuation compared to a 4 μm-thick, spin-coated film, operated between 100 and 800 V. The force of the presented 200 nm-thin film cantilever actuator was about 10-4 N. This means that a multilayer actuator with more than 104 layers would reach forces comparable to natural muscles. Therefore, such nanostructures can qualify for medical applications for example to treat severe incontinence.},

This disorder most frequently affects only one eye (unilateral) and develops slowly over time. Attachment of portions of the iris to the cornea (peripheral anterior synechiae) and subsequent closure of the drainage angle may lead to secondary glaucoma and vision loss. Essential iris atrophy is one of three iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndromes, each of which usually affects one eye of young to middle-aged men and women. The ICE syndromes (essential iris atrophy, Chandler syndrome, and Cogan-Reese syndrome) are distinct from one another. However, these disorders all affect the eyeand some of their symptoms overlap, making it difficult to distinguish between them.

The conductivity related to the tunneling distance is obtained by a simple equation, and its role is considered by using an extended CNT (including CNT and the tunneling space). Additionally, the effects of the interphase and CNT waviness on the percolation threshold, effective filler fraction, and percentages of percolated CNT are expressed by simple equations. The suggested model is evaluated by experimental results and the influences of CNTs and interphase parameters on the conductivity are plotted and justified. The predictions demonstrate good agreement with the experimental results, which allow the estimation of percolation threshold, interphase thickness, and tunneling distance. The conductivity changes from 0 to 350 S m-1 at different parameter ranges, where the best conductivity is obtained by the smallest waviness and the shortest tunneling distance. Generally, the high concentration of thin, long, straight, and super-conductive CNT, thick interphase, dense network, short tunneling distance, and poor percolation threshold present desirable conductivity.},

In medical applications, however, voltages as low as a few tens of volts are required. To this end, we prepared nanometer-thin dielectric elastomer layers. It is demonstrated that alternating current, electro-spray deposition allows for the fabrication of homogenous, flat, nanometer-thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films. The growth of the PDMS with average number molecular weights ranging from 800 to 62,700 g/mol, at a constant flow rate of 267 nL/s, was in situ monitored by means of spectroscopic ellipsometry. The Cauchy layer model used for data interpretation may only be applied to flat PDMS layers. Thus, in the present study the droplet morphology was also determined by atomic force microscopy. Spectroscopic ellipsometry does allow for the qualitative determination of the thin film morphology. However, for high molecular weight polymers the precise measurement during deposition is challenging. Independent of the molecular weight, the roughness of the deposited PDMS films considerably smoothens during the ultra-violet radiation treatment. After curing, the electro-sprayed nanometer-thin PDMS films are homogeneous enough to qualify for the fabrication of low-voltage DEA.}

Between 24 (1) and 37 (2) myosin subfamilies are currently recognized (3), the myriad members of which are specialized for tasks ranging from muscle contraction through to mechano-sensation and signaling, cell polarization, the sliding and tensioning of cytoskeletal elements, organelle transport, exocytosis and endocytosis, and vesicle transport. The molecular mechanism by which myosins step along actin filaments is accordingly a central problem, studies of which have been greatly facilitated in recent years by the discovery of processive myosins. Processive myosins can take many sequential steps along an actin filament, remaining attached throughout. One such is myosin-V (4), a twin-headed myosin that walks along actin filaments toward their fast-growing (blunt) ends, measuring out paces that correspond more or less exactly to the 36-nm helical repeat of the actin filament. The precisely metered stepping action is a function of the length of the neck (5), an extended regulatory domain of six calmodulin-binding IQ motifs that link each head to the coiled-coil tail. The favored 36-nm step allows the motor to pick out a linear pathway along a helical actin filament; however, recent work has revealed that off-axis binding can and does occur (6, 7). Like other molecular motors, myosin-V works directionally, with forward steps being favored over backward steps. Sustained directional stepping by any motor against a load requires an energy source, which, in the case of the myosins, is supplied by the hydrolytic conversion of ATP into ADP and Pi. Coupling the mechanical stepping cycle to ATP turnover in this way allows the myosin-V motor to step continuously against a load of up to 2-3 pN, consistent with its using one ATP per 36-nm step. Above 2-3 pN, the motor stalls, pausing with both heads attached to … *E-mail: r.crossatmcri.ac.uk},

However, the electrode patterns are mostly designed by the trial and error, limited by the designer's experience and inspirations. This paper introduces a computational method termed topology optimization for the design of electrode patterns to maximize the output displacement of DEAs. With the theoretical model of DEAs, the optimization model of electrode patterns on DE films is built and solved by the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) gradient method. Two actuators are designed as examples and tested for verification. The designed motions are obtained in experiments and the results agree well with the simulations, which shows the proposed method is effective.},

	abstract     = {Polymers play an essential role in our everyday life due to their employment in a widespread range of applications. Polymers are used in industries such as space, biomedical, electronics, etc. in which their electrical and mechanical properties are major aspects which need to be investigated prior to implementation. When subjected to mechanical stimulations, polymers may exhibit changes in electrical conductivity which can vary locally within the specimens, especially in those of conducting polymers. In mechanical investigations a tensile testing machine is used to understand polymers’ strength, elasticity or other mechanical properties. In electrical analysis, using a four-point probe to examine the electrical resistivity (conductivity) of a material is also frequently applied. However, no studies have been done to explore the relationship between mechanical manipulations and changes in electrical properties in situ. The current study explores this relationship. An electrical conductivity testing system is designed and developed to couple with a tensile testing machine to measure the electrical conductivity of polymeric specimens while experiencing tensile loading. The system features a commercial four-point probe sensor, which is automatically controlled to approach a specimen and to measure the electrical conductivity of that specimen locally in two directions: longitudinally and transversely to the axis of stress. The method of testing is then implemented to experiment on specimens of high density polyethylene. Other types of specimens such as carbon nanotubes/polyethylene composites and metallic surface layer deposited polyethylene are also tested. Descriptions of the development process of the robotic systems and results of the execution are presented.},

Modelling was based on independent electrical and mechanical analyses of the specific configuration of the device. The expressions of the electrostatic pressures exerted by the electrodes in response to an applied voltage were formulated and inserted into the expressions of the actuator mechanical deformations, obtained by assuming linearly elastic stress-strain constitutive equations of the material for small strains. Values of axial strains expected from the model well fit those recorded from a realised actuator, electrically stimulated by step-wise high voltages. This actuator has carbon grease electrodes smeared on a cylinder-shaped silicone elastomer, showing a room-temperature-relative dielectric constant of 3 within a wide frequency range (10-109 Hz). An axial strain of 4.5% due to a voltage per unit wall thickness of 100 V/μm was measured at a 5% axial prestrain, around which the material held a Young's modulus of 5 MPa. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

By introducing a percolation network model, this work reveals theoretically that the observed rapidly drops of conductivity in thin films mainly depends on the change of CNT network morphology during spin coating. Junctions formed by structural distorted tubes are also observed at the cross section of film samples. By considering both CNT re-orientation and CNT structural distortion into percolation network model, the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental data.

In this paper, excellent stretchable and high conductive rubber composites based on room temperature vulcanized (RTV) silicone rubber with carbon fiber (CF) and carbon black (CB) are prepared through the solution method and the ultrasonic dispersion technology. The morphology results show that CF and CB in the composites formed a 3D collaborative conductive network of bridge connection. Then, both the sensitive characteristic and strain-sensing mechanism of CF/CB-RTV silicone rubber sensors have been investigated, which exhibits excellent stretchability as high as 700% and has a good linear relationship with 0–375% strain range and the maximum gauge factor of 182. Also, it has been found that the composites with 12.5 wt% CB maintained good electrical conductivity in the case of large deformation. Finally, CF/CB-RTV conductive composites have been used for human motion monitoring with high sensitivity, and as flexible electrodes in LED bulbs, which still have significant brightness under the 300% strain of the composites with 12.5 wt% CB.}

The sprays are all operated in the cone-jet mode in which a liquid is pumped through a metal capillary, at the exit of which it is accelerated through a conical meniscus terminating into a microjet. The acceleration is caused by the electric field established once a voltage differential is applied between the capillary and a counter-electrode. The jet breaks up farther downstream into fine, charged droplets that disperse into an (electro)spray. Key aspects highlighted are: the mechanism of electrostatic/inertia separation by which monodispersity of the droplet size distribution is ensured; the parameters controlling the size and charge of the droplets and some relevant scaling laws; the disruptive phenomenon limiting the maximum charge that a droplet can stably retain; the electric field within the spray and the relative importance of the external field applied between the electrodes and the internal one due to the droplet Coulombic repulsion. The review concludes with a brief description of some applications in the areas of mass-spectrometry (electrospray ionization), combustion, targeted drug inhalation, aerosol science, materials synthesis, deposition technologies and electric propulsion.}

	abstract     = {When a muscle contracts and shortens against a load, it performs work. The performance of work is fuelled by the expenditure of metabolic energy, more properly quantified as enthalpy (i.e., heat plus work). The ratio of work performed to enthalpy produced provides one measure of efficiency. However, if the primary interest is in the efficiency of the actomyosin cross-bridges, then the metabolic overheads associated with basal metabolism and excitation-contraction coupling, together with those of subsequent metabolic recovery process, must be subtracted from the total heat and work observed. By comparing the cross-bridge work component of the remainder to the Gibbs free energy of hydrolysis of ATP, a measure of thermodynamic efficiency is achieved. We describe and quantify this partitioning process, providing estimates of the efficiencies of selected steps, while discussing the errors that can arise in the process of quantification. The dependence of efficiency on animal species, fibre-type, temperature, and contractile velocity is considered. The effect of contractile velocity on energetics is further examined using a two-state, Huxley-style, mathematical model of cross-bridge cycling that incorporates filament compliance. Simulations suggest only a modest effect of filament compliance on peak efficiency, but progressively larger gains (vis-a-vis the rigid filament case) as contractile velocity approaches Vmax. This effect is attributed primarily to a reduction in the component of energy loss arising from detachment of cross-bridge heads at non-zero strain.},

For the first time, we present here a structured overview of all the approaches proposed so far to model soft robots.

Nevertheless, animals can still perform a vast range of activities with unmatched effectiveness. Many studies in biomechanics have pointed to the elastic and compliant nature of the musculoskeletal system as a fundamental ingredient explaining this gap. Thus, to reach performance comparable to nature, elastic elements have been introduced in rigid-bodied robots, leading to articulated soft robotics [1] (see 'Summary'). In continuum soft robotics, this concept is brought to an extreme. Here, softness is not concentrated at the joint level but instead distributed across the whole structure. As a result, soft robots (henceforth, omitting the adjective continuum) are entirely made of continuously deformable elements. This design solution aims to bring robots closer to invertebrate animals and the soft appendices of vertebrate animals (for example, an elephant's trunk and the tail of a monkey). Several soft robotic hardware platforms have been proposed with increasingly higher reliability and functionalities. In this process, considerable attention has been devoted to the technological side of the problem, leading to a large assortment of hardware solutions. In turn, this abundance opened up the challenge of developing effective control strategies that can manage the soft body and exploit its embodied intelligence.},

IPMC sensing can be implemented in multiple ways, resulting in significantly different sensing characteristics. This paper will review the methods and research efforts to use IPMCs as deformation sensors. We will address efforts to model the IPMC sensing phenomenon, and implementation and characteristics of different IPMC sensing methods. Proposed sensing methods are divided into active sensing, passive sensing, and self-sensing actuation (SSA), whereas the active sensing methods measure one of IPMC-generated voltage, charge, or current; passive methods measure variations in IPMC impedances, or use it in capacitive sensor element circuit, and SSA methods implement simultaneous sensing and actuation on the same IPMC sample. Frequency ranges for reliable sensing vary among the methods, and no single method has been demonstrated to be effective for sensing in the full spectrum of IPMC actuation capabilities, i.e., from DC to ∼100 Hz. However, this limitation can be overcome by combining several sensing methods.},

This hope has been realized, and some astonishingly simple and accurate relations have been found, relations, moreover, which (among other things) determine the effect of load on speed of shortening, allow the form of the isometric contraction to be predicted, and are the basis of the so-called “visco-elasticity” of skeletal muscle. This paper is divided into three parts. In Part I further developments of the technique are described: everything has depended on the technique, so no apology is needed for a rather full description of it and of the precautions necessary. In Part II the results themselves are described and discussed. In Part III the “visco-elastic” properties of active muscle are shown to be a consequence of the properties described in Part II.}

Actual contraction depends upon a neural signal that results in the sliding of actin filaments past myosin to produce shortening. These molecular events are translated into whole muscle shortening by the connective tissue layers that surround the muscle fibers. Muscles are highly adaptive to training. Fast and slow muscle fibers respond differently to different forms of training, and they respond differently to fatigue. Both the normal growth and adaptation of muscle fibers depend upon the activities of satellite cells, which serve as stem cells to muscles. Muscle atrophy is an adaptation to the loss of function, and after injury, muscle fibers regenerate through the contribution of satellite cells. Many age-related changes in muscle are secondary to changes in their innervation.},

We show that the FVM allows one to interpret the stress inside a tetrahedron as a simple "multidimensional force" pushing on each face. Moreover, this interpretation leads to a heuristic method for calculating the force on each node, which is as simple to implement and comprehend as masses and springs. In the finite volume spirit, we also present a geometric rather than interpolating function definition of strain. We use the FVM and a quasi-incompressible, transversely isotropic, hyperelastic constitutive model to simulate contracting muscle tissue. B-spline solids are used to model fiber directions, and the muscle activation levels are derived from key frame animations.}

	abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Rapid muscle fatigue during functional electrical stimulation (FES)-evoked muscle contractions in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) is a significant limitation to attaining health benefits of FES-exercise. Delaying the onset of muscle fatigue is often cited as an important goal linked to FES clinical efficacy. Although the basic concept of fatigue-resistance has a long history, recent advances in biomedical engineering, physiotherapy and clinical exercise science have achieved improved clinical benefits, especially for reducing muscle fatigue during FES-exercise. This review evaluated the methodological quality of strategies underlying muscle fatigue-resistance that have been used to optimize FES therapeutic approaches. The review also sought to synthesize the effectiveness of these strategies for persons with SCI in order to establish their functional impacts and clinical relevance. METHODS: Published scientific literature pertaining to the reduction of FES-induced muscle fatigue was identified through searches of the following databases: Science Direct, Medline, IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink, PubMed and Nature, from the earliest returned record until June 2015. Titles and abstracts were screened to obtain 35 studies that met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. RESULTS: Following the evaluation of methodological quality (mean (SD), 50 (6) \%) of the reviewed studies using the Downs and Black scale, the largest treatment effects reported to reduce muscle fatigue mainly investigated isometric contractions of limited functional and clinical relevance (n = 28). Some investigations (n = 13) lacked randomisation, while others were characterised by small sample sizes with low statistical power. Nevertheless, the clinical significance of emerging trends to improve fatigue-resistance during FES included (i) optimizing electrode positioning, (ii) fine-tuning of stimulation patterns and other FES parameters, (iii) adjustments to the mode and frequency of exercise training, and (iv) biofeedback-assisted FES-exercise to promote selective recruitment of fatigue-resistant motor units. CONCLUSION: Although the need for further in-depth clinical trials (especially RCTs) was clearly warranted to establish external validity of outcomes, current evidence was sufficient to support the validity of certain techniques for rapid fatigue-reduction in order to promote FES therapy as an integral part of SCI rehabilitation. It is anticipated that this information will be valuable to clinicians and other allied health professionals administering FES as a treatment option in rehabilitation and aid the development of effective rehabilitation interventions.},

Movement of human limbs is achieved by joint torques and each torque is specified as the sum of torques generated by muscle forces. The behavior of individual muscles is controlled by the neural input which is estimated by means of an electromyogram (EMG). In this study, the EMGs for a flexor and an extensor are measured in elbow joint movements and the dynamic behavior of individual muscles is analyzed. As a result, it is verified that both a flexor and an extensor are activated throughout the entire movement and that the activation of muscles is controlled above a specific limit independent of the hand-held load. Subsequently, a system model for simulating elbow joint movements is developed which includes the muscle dynamic relationship between the neural input and the isometric force. The minimum limit of muscle activation that has been confirmed in experiments is provided as a constraint of the neural input and the criterion is defined by a derivative of the isometric force of individual muscles. The optimal trajectories formulated under these conditions are quantitatively compared with the experimentally observed trajectories, and the control strategy of a muscular control system is studied. Finally, a muscular control system in multi-joint arm movements is discussed with regard to the comparative analysis between observed and optimal trajectories.},

Hydrogels containing electrolyte can work as ionic conductors to actuate DEAs. Compliant electrodes, as a promising supplement for DEAs, should conduct under high voltages without electrolysis. A fixed volume of fluid is constrained by a DE membrane, and adheres tightly to a DE membrane; They both could deform with external force. Applied voltage, pre-load, and moisture content of electrodes affect the actuation responds. We study the theoretically data based on transparent VHB material coupling hydrogel electrodes, and present the transparent DEA that drives focus lens system. Computational results show basic characteristics of the DEAs for lens. When a voltage is applied to the fabricated lens module, optical focal length changes with the voltage. The lens system could find application in portable devices, such as digital cameras and cell phones, etc.},

Two well-studied DEA concepts are represented by stacked and membrane DEAs, respectively. The first configuration is known for providing high forces, while the second one results in high strokes. This work proposes a novel design solution, which combines the advantages of both concepts, i.e., high force and stroke, based on a stack of high stroke (3 mm) membrane DEAs. While a single silicone-based DE membrane provides an actuation force on the order of hundreds of mN only, the proposed stacking results into a parallel mechanical connection, which increases the overall force to the double-digit newton range. The biasing mechanism, which is necessary to operate the dielectric elastomer membrane as an actuator, is placed within the passive frame of the DEAs, leading to an overall compact design. To demonstrate the potential of the concept, two prototypes capable of generating record high forces are assembled and tested. The first one allows to lift a weight of 10 kg up to 3 mm, while the second one allows to generate a compression force of 87 N, while working compressing a linear spring with a stiffness of 30.7 N mm-1 up to 2.8mm. These prototypes allow to establish a boosting factor of about 200 for the force output of membrane DEAs.},

The proposed active structure has the capability of exhibiting uniaxial contractive deformations, while being exposed to external tensile forces. The serial arrangement of active segments has one contracting degree of freedom in the thickness direction of the dielectric EAP film layers. Due to the envisaged tension force transmission capability, special attention is paid to the electrode design which is of paramount importance with regard to functionality of the actuator. A compliant electrode system with anisotropic deformation properties is presented based on nano scale carbon powder. In experiments, the free deformation as well as the contractive motion under external tensile loading of several actuator configurations with different setups is characterized.

	abstract	 = {The concept of merging pre-processed textile materials with tailored mechanical properties into soft matrices is so far rarely used in the field of soft robotics. The herein presented work takes the advantages of textile materials in elastomer matrices to another level by integrating a material with highly anisotropic bending properties. A pre-fabricated textile material consisting of oriented carbon fibers is used as a stiff component to precisely control the mechanical behavior of the robotic setup. The presented robotic concept uses a multi-layer stack for the robot’s body and dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) on both outer sides of it. The bending motion of the whole structure results from the combination of its mechanically adjusted properties and the force generation of the DEAs. We present an antagonistic switching setup for the DEAs that leads to deflections to both sides of the robot, following a biomimetic principle. To investigate the bending behavior of the robot, we show a simulation model utilizing electromechanical coupling to estimate the quasi-static deflection of the structure. Based on this model, a statement about the bending behavior of the structure in general is made, leading to an expected maximum deflection of 10 mm at the end of the fin for a static activation. Furthermore, we present an electromechanical network model to evaluate the frequency dependent behavior of the robot’s movement, predicting a resonance frequency of 6.385 Hz for the dynamic switching case. Both models in combination lead to a prediction about the acting behavior of the robot. These theoretical predictions are underpinned by dynamic performance measurements in air for different switching frequencies of the DEAs, leading to a maximum deflection of 9.3 mm located at the end of the actuators. The herein presented work places special focus on the mechanical resonance frequency of the robotic setup with regard to maximum deflections.},

	abstract     = {Electro-elastomers are large strain smart materials capable of both sensing and actuation. Typical electro-elastomer setups consist of either a silicone or acrylic membrane sandwiched between two compliant grease electrodes. Silicone electro-elastomers have maximum elastic strains between 200\% and 350\%. Acrylic electro-elastomers are more widely employed due to larger actuation strains but are softer than silicone and have a lower force output [Goulbourne, N.C., Frecker, M., Mockensturm, E.M., Snyder, A.J., 2003. Modeling of a dielectric elastomer diaphragm for a prosthetic blood pump. In: Proceedings of SPIE, Smart Structures and Materials: EAPAD, San Diego; Goulbourne, N.C., Mockensturm, E.M., Frecker, M., 2005b. Quasi-static and dynamic inflation of a dielectric elastomer membrane. In: Proceedings of SPIE, Smart Structures and Materials: EAPAD, San Diego]. A numerical formulation for the large deformation response of electro-elastomer membranes subject to electromechanical loading is derived in this paper. The approach is based on modifying the elastic membrane theory of Green, Adkins, and Rivlin [Adkins, J.E., Rivlin, R.S., 1952. Large elastic deformations of isotropic materials IX. The deformation of thin shells. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series A Mathematical and Physical Sciences 244, 505-531; Green, A.E., Adkins, J.E., 1970. Large Elastic Deformations. Oxford University Press, London]. The electro-elastic stress state is defined as the combination of the electrical Maxwell stress and the mechanical stress for hyperelastic materials [Goulbourne, N.C., Mockensturm, E.M., Frecker, M., 2005a. A nonlinear model for dielectric elastomer membranes. ASME Journal of Applied Mechanics 72, (6) 899-906]. This paper augments our previous work by presenting a mathematical solution procedure for simulating the field responsive behavior of silicone electro-elastomers configured for both in-plane and out-of-plane deformation. Thin axisymmetric membranes subject to electromechanical loads are the focus of this investigation. The numerical analysis shows that there is a delicate balance between the electrical and the mechanical portions of the stress, which must be maintained for the overall stress to remain tensile and by extension the electro-elastomer to remain stable. It is shown that at very high voltages the stress can become negative ultimately leading to transducer failure. For sensing applications, the varying capacitive behavior of electro-elastomers is used to extract information about the membrane’s deformed state.},

The great potential of employing such hydrogels that respond to various stimuli (e.g., pH, temperature, light, electricity, and magnetic fields) for actuation purposes has been revealed by their performances in real-time biosensing systems, targeted drug delivery, artificial muscle reconstruction, and cell microenvironment engineering. In this review, the material selection of hydrogels with multiple stimulus-responsive mechanisms for actuator fabrication is first introduced, followed by a detailed introduction to and discussion of the most recent progress in emerging biomedical applications of hydrogel-based bioactuators.

This study sought to determine the directions of wound closure that would result in least wound tension after skin lesion excisions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Some 1181 consecutive skin lesion excisions were investigated (age range 13-95 years, median 64 years) using a tensiometer to determine directions of least wound tension. These lines were mapped. Skin tension measurements were taken during the procedure and analysed. The clear majority of excisions were for skin cancer and the others were for cysts or dysplastic naevi. Lesions such as lipomas, which entail incisional rather than excisional surgery (i.e. where overlying skin was not excised) were excluded. All lesions were cut out in a circular fashion following tension measurements. Closure was undertaken in the direction of least tension (biodynamic excisional skin tension line) and this was illustrated. This process was repeated in all cases where body site and direction of closure was mapped. Statistical analyses were undertaken on a series on the scalp and lower limb. RESULTS Biodynamic excisional skin tension lines have a clear directional preference: scalp-coronal direction, limbs--vertical orientation of ellipses and trunk - mostly horizontal except oblique at the shoulder and scapular regions. DISCUSSION Skin cancer excisions often end up with poor cosmetic results, owing to inconsistency in identifying the correct excisional wound closure lines. This has not been helped by the (hitherto) lack of large in vivo biomechanical studies, and because incisional lines and excisional lines have not been considered separately in surgical practice. Orientating ellipses or wound closures using biodynamic excisional skin tension lines offers a guide to reducing wound tension and minimising wound complications or scarring after cutaneous surgery.},

Furthermore, devices for the measurement of skin function in vivo generate relative values rather than formal mechanical measures, therefore limiting the ability to compare studies. In this viewpoint essay, we discuss key biomechanical concepts and the influence of technical and biological factors (including the nature of the testing apparatus, length scale, donor age and anatomical site) on measured mechanical properties such as stiffness. Having discussed the current state-of-the-art in macro-mechanical and micromechanical measuring techniques and in mathematical and computational modelling methods, we then make suggestions as to how these approaches, in combination with 3D X-ray imaging and mechanics methods, may be adopted into a single strategy to characterise the mechanical behaviour of skin.},

The Young's Modulus of skin is an important factor to estimate the characteristics of skin, to determine the course of a disease or to follow a cosmetic application. Methods: The mechanical behaviour of the skin is measured by changing the shape of skin by employing tensile, indentation, and suction and torsion tests. Results: Out of all the skin's mechanical testing methods, suction tests are a common choice for skin testing, as they are easy to apply in vivo and consider both in-plane and normal loading conditions. Skin is found to be highly anisotropic and viscoelastic, with a range of Young's Modulus between 5 kPa and 140 MPa. Conclusion: This paper reviews in vivo and in vitro reported values for Young's Modulus of human skin for tensile, indentation, suction and torsion mechanical testing methods.},

In this study, we have investigated the influence of location and orientation on the deformation characteristics of 56 samples of excised human skin. Uniaxial tensile tests were carried out at a strain rate of 0.012 s -1 on skin from the back. Digital Image Correlation was used for 2D strain measurement and a histological examination of the dermis was also performed. The mean ultimate tensile strength (UTS) was 21.6±8.4 MPa, the mean failure strain 54%±17%, the mean initial slope 1.18±0.88 MPa, the mean elastic modulus 83.3±34.9 MPa and the mean strain energy was 3.6±1.6 MJ/m 3. A multivariate analysis of variance has shown that these mechanical properties of skin are dependent upon the orientation of the Langer lines (P<0.0001-P=0.046). The location of specimens on the back was also found to have a significant effect on the UTS (P=0.0002), the elastic modulus (P=0.001) and the strain energy (P=0.0052). The histological investigation concluded that there is a definite correlation between the orientation of the Langer lines and the preferred orientation of collagen fibres in the dermis (P<0.001).

The authors compare two tests for spatial resolution and two for cutaneous pressure threshold in an adult patient cohort having undergone microsurgical digital nerve repair after traumatic transection. Methods: Patients who underwent epineural coaptation after digital nerve transection at the authors' institution between June of 2006 and December of 2011 were asked to participate in a follow-up examination assessing spatial resolution (two-point discrimination and grating orientation test) and cutaneous pressure threshold (Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test and pressure-specifying sensory device). Interinstrument correlations were conducted and critically elucidated. Results: Eighty-one patients (26 female and 55 male patients; median age, 42 years; interquartile range, 23 years) were examined with a mean follow-up period of 3.5 ± 1.4 years. Although all tests could differentiate between the healthy and operated fingers, poor to moderate correlations were found between two-point discrimination and grating orientation test (poperated = 0.483, p < 0.0001; phealthy = 0.350, p < 0.0001), and between Semmes-Weinstein mono-filament test and Pressure-Specified Sensory Device testing (poperated = 0.287, p = 0.01; phealthy = 0.382, p < 0.001), indicating that they measure different properties. Altogether, the grating orientation test proved superior to two-point discrimination, whereas Pressure-Specified Sensory Device testing was superior to Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing. Conclusions: Thoughtful use of test instruments is advisable when assessing sensibility of the hand. This study suggests including Pressure-Specified Sensory Device testing to assess cutaneous pressure threshold and the grating orientation test to assess spatial resolution in clinical, routine test batteries.},

Previous research has shown that the threshold of TPD increases with aging or pathological conditions such as stroke or chronic pain. It has also been reported that the threshold can be decreased by continuous tactile or electrical stimulation. The cognitive process in the cortex has been shown to be involved in the determination of the TPD threshold. However, the reliability of TPD has been questioned, because differences in the firing rate of the responding receptors and afferent fibers occur, depending on how the measuring instrument is applied. To investigate the influence of the stimulus condition on the TPD threshold, we utilized a computer-controlled two-point tactile stimulator and measured the TPD threshold by alternating stimulus speed and stimulus penetration depths. We found that a stimulus speed of 5.0 mm/s or 10.0 mm/s and a stimulus penetration depth of 1.0 mm were the optimum condition for measurement, at which the TPD threshold becomes lowest. We also found that no influence is exerted on the threshold by repeated measurement under the stimulus conditions utilized in this experiment. Our findings suggest that TPD measurement should be performed under certain stimulus conditions, as identified in this present study, to obtain reliable results that reflect the highest ability of the subject for spatial discrimination.},

	abstract     = {Sensibility is much more than protective sensation, and the examiner needs to consider the various degrees of residual sensibility that influence both diagnosis and prognosis. Towards that end, objective tests of the extent and nature of peripheral nerve involvement should be employed. Objective tests reflect the current condition of sensibility and are not affected by cognitive influences, such as re-education. Most current clinical instruments used for measurement of sensibility fail to meet the criteria of an objective test because they: (1) can be shown to lack necessary sensitivity, and (2) are too variable. As a consequence, regardless of whether these instruments have been used in controlled clinical studies or are in common use, their results will not replicate with repeated testing. Unfortunately, therefore, sensibility changes will potentially go unrecognized in a large number of patients and many will be detected only in the later stages of peripheral nerve abnormality, when possibilities of treatment are less effective. This article discusses sensibility testing from the standpoint of what is known regarding strengths and weaknesses of various tests and sensory modalities, and makes an appeal for clinicians to review the instruments they use critically for sensibility measurement with regard to stimulu's control. Clinicians must insist on validity and reliability in their instruments before they have confidence in the data obtained. © 1993, Hanley & Belfus, Inc.. All rights reserved.},

The mean ultimate tensile stress, mean elastic modulus and mean strain energy increased with increasing strain rates. While the stretch ratio at ultimate tensile stress was not affected by the strain rate, it was influenced by the orientation of the samples (parallel and perpendicular to the Langer lines. The orientation of the sample also had a strong influence on the ultimate tensile stress, with a mean value of 28.0±5.7MPa for parallel samples, and 15.6±5.2MPa for perpendicular samples, and on the elastic modulus, with corresponding mean values of 160.8MPa±53.2MPa and 70.6MPa±59.5MPa. The study also pointed out the difficulties in controlling the effective applied strain rate in dynamic characterization of soft tissue and the resulting abnormal stress-strain relationships.

Contributing to this problem is the mechanical discontinuity of the skin/device interface leading to stress concentrations and micro-trauma that chronically breaks any seal that forms. In this paper, we have quantified the mechanical behavior of human skin under low-magnitude shear loads over physiological relevant frequencies. Using a stress-controlled rheometer, we have performed isothermal (37 °C) frequency response experiments between 0.628 and 75.39 rad/s at 0.5% and 0.04% strain on whole skin and dermis-only, respectively. Step-stress experiments of 5 and 10 Pa shear loads were also conducted as were strain sweep tests (6.28 rad/s). Measurements were made of whole human skin and skin from which the epidermis was removed (dermis-only). At low frequencies (0.628-10 rad/s), the moduli are only slightly frequency dependent, with approximate power-law scaling of the moduli, G′∼G″∼ωβ, yielding β=0.05 for whole skin and β=0.16 for dermis-only samples. Step-stress experiments revealed three distinct phases. The intermediate phase included elastic "ringing" (damped oscillation) which provided new insights and could be fit to a mathematical model. Both the frequency and step-stress response data suggest that the epidermis provides an elastic rigidity and dermis provides viscoelasticity to the whole skin samples. Hence, whole skin exhibited strain hardening while the dermis-only demonstrated stress softening under step-stress conditions. The data obtained from the low-magnitude shear loads and frequencies that approximate the chronic mechanical environment of a percutaneous implant should aid in the design of a device with an improved skin seal. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, an iterative-fitting methodology visualizes the time-dependent viscoelastic behavior of human skin cells under physiologically relevant conditions. Past investigations often involved parameterizing elastic relationships and assuming purely Hertzian contact mechanics, which fails to properly account for the rich temporal information available. We demonstrate the performance superiority of the proposed iterative viscoelastic characterization method over standard open-search approaches. Our viscoelastic measurements revealed that 2D adherent metastatic melanoma cells exhibit reduced elasticity compared to their normal counterparts—melanocytes and fibroblasts, and are significantly less viscous than fibroblasts over timescales spanning three orders of magnitude. The measured loss angle indicates clear differential viscoelastic responses across multiple timescales between the measured cells. This method provides insight into the complex viscoelastic behavior of metastatic melanoma cells relevant to better understanding cancer metastasis and aggression. Parvini, Cartagena and Solares introduce an iterative viscoelastic approach based on the generalized Maxwell and Kelvin-Voigt models. The results showed that metastatic melanoma cells had lower elasticity than normal fibroblasts and melanoma cells were less viscous than the fibroblasts over a large frequency range, enhancing the understanding of cellular responses at different frequencies.},

	abstract     = {Human skin is innervated with different tactile afferents, which are found at varying densities over the body. We investigate how the relationships between tactile pleasantness, sensitivity and discrimination differ across the skin. Tactile pleasantness was assessed by stroking a soft brush over the skin, using five velocities (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 cm s-1), known to differentiate hedonic touch, and pleasantness ratings were gained. The ratings velocity-profile is known to correlate with firing in unmyelinated C-tactile (CT) afferents. Tactile sensitivity thresholds were determined using monofilament force detection and the tactile discrimination level was obtained in the direction discrimination of a moving probe; both tasks readily activate myelinated touch receptors. Perceptions were measured over five skin sites: forehead, arm, palm, thigh and shin. The assessment of tactile pleasantness over the skin resulted in a preference for the middle velocities (1-10 cm s-1), where higher ratings were gained compared to the slowest and fastest velocities. This preference in tactile pleasantness was found across all the skin sites, apart from at the palm, where no decrease in pleasantness for the faster stroking velocities was seen. We find that tactile sensitivity and discrimination vary across the skin, where the forehead and palm show increased acuity. Tactile sensitivity and discrimination levels also correlated significantly, although the tactile acuity did not relate to the perceived pleasantness of touch. Tactile pleasantness varied in a subtle way across skin sites, where the middle velocities were always rated as the most pleasant, but the ratings at hairy skin sites were more receptive to changes in stroking velocity. We postulate that although the mechanoreceptive afferent physiology may be different over the skin, the perception of pleasant touch can be interpreted using all of the available incoming somatosensory information in combination with central processing. © 2014 Ackerley, Carlsson, Wester, Olausson and Backlund Wasling.},

In this study, an ultrasound indentation system with a pen-size hand-held probe developed earlier by the authors was used to obtain the indentation responses of lower limb soft tissues. Indentation tests were conducted on normal young subjects with four females and four males at four sites with three body postures. A linear elastic indentation solution was used to extract the effective Young's modulus from the indentation responses. The determined modulus ranged from 10.4 to 89.2 kPa for the soft tissues tested. These results were in a similar range as those reported in the literature. The thickness of the lower limb soft tissues varied slightly with body posture changes. The Young's modulus determined was demonstrated to be significantly dependent on site, posture, subject and gender. The overall mean modulus of male subjects was 40% larger than that of female subjects.

	abstract     = {The human skin is composed of several layers, each with an unique structure and function. Knowledge about the mechanical behavior of these skin layers is important for clinical and cosmetic research, such as the development of personal care products and the understanding of skin diseases. Until today, most research was performed in vivo and focused on the mid-layer, the dermis. However, clinical and cosmetic applications require more detailed knowledge about the skin layers at the skin surface, the viable epidermis and stratum corneum, and the deeper lying hypodermis. Studying these layers in an in vivo set up is very challenging. The different length scales, ranging from µm for the stratum corneum to cm for the hypodermis, the interwoven layered structure and the inverse relation between penetration depth and resolution of non-invasive measurement techniques form major problems. As a consequence, hardly any data are available for the viable epidermis and hypodermis and reported data for stratum corneum are inconsistent. The aim of this thesis was therefore to characterize the mechanical behavior of individual skin layers in vitro and, for that, to develop the required experimental procedures. It was considered essential to perform experiments with samples of consistent quality in an accurate measurement set-up in a well-controlled environment. Various isolation and preservation methods were investigated on tissue performance, reproducibility and ease of handling. Because of the inhomogeneous layered structure of the upper skin layers, mechanical properties of the stratum corneum and viable epidermis were determined for various loading directions. First, the stratum corneum and epidermis were subjected to shear over a wide frequency range and with varying temperature and humidity. The typical geometry of the upper skin layers required preliminary testing series in order to define the right experimental conditions to ensure reliable results. Subsequently, micro-indentation experiments were applied using a spherical tip with a relatively large diameter. The Young¿s moduli were derived via an analytical and numerical method. Because of the complexity of measuring those skin layers, it was decided to focus on small deformations first. For both types of loading, result were highly reproducible. The shear tests demonstrated that the shear modulus is influenced by humidity but not by temperature in the measured range. If the skin is compressed with an indenter, the stiffness of the epidermis and stratum corneum, which is about 1-2 MPa, is about a factor 100 higher than for shear. No significant differences in stiffness between the stratum corneum and viable epidermis were observed per loading type. The results of these tests prove that it is essential to take into account the highly anisotropy of the tissue in numerical models...},

	abstract     = {The use of conductive polymer composites (CPCs) for strain sensing applications has attracted intense interest lately. The stability and sensitivity of resistivity–strain behaviour are thought to be important issues, but systematic investigations are missing. Herein, the resistivity–strain behavior in terms of stability and sensitivity of CPCs based on poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene) (SBS) containing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are studied. It is demonstrated that the preparation method has an important influence on the resistivity–strain behavior of these CPCs. Under linear uniaxial strain, the sensitivity increases with decreasing filler content for both composites, showing higher strain sensitivity near the percolation threshold. Moreover, a higher and wider range of sensitivities is obtained for SBS/MWCNT composites from melt mixing. Under dynamic strain, resistivity downward drifting and shoulder peaks are shown for composites from melt mixing, while linear relationships and reversible resistivity in every cycle are observed for composites from solution mixing, showing good electromechanical consistency, stability and durability. From the TEM, rheology, SEM, SAXS, Raman microscopy and analytical modeling studies, the difference in morphology is thought to be responsible for such resistivity–strain behavior. As more disordered and less densely packed conductive networks in melt-mixed CPCs are more easily destroyed under strain, evenly distributed and densely packed networks in solution mixed CPCs are more stable during cyclic stretching. Finally, human knee motions have been detected using these CPCs, demonstrating a potential application of these CPCs as movement sensors.},

Several authors have attempted to model the piezoresistive response of conductive polymer composites.

Similarly, the models available in literature assume a voltage-independent resistance and a stress-independent area for tunneling conduction. With the aim of developing and validating a more comprehensive model, a test bench capable of exerting controlled forces has been developed. Commercially available sensors—which are manufactured from conductive polymer composites—have been tested at different voltages and stresses, and a model has been derived on the basis of equations for the quantum tunneling conduction through thin insulating film layers. The resistance contribution from the contact resistance has been included in the model together with the resistance contribution from the conductive particles. The proposed model embraces a voltage-dependent behavior for the composite resistance, and a stress-dependent behavior for the tunneling conduction area. The proposed model is capable of predicting sensor current based upon information from the sourcing voltage and the applied stress.

At present, the use of dielectric elastomer actuators working as capacitors appears a promising option. Acrylic or silicone elastomers with carbon nanotubes functioning as the electrode achieve mechanical performances similar to human muscle in vitro. However, mechanical, electrical, and biological issues have prevented clinical application to date. Here materials and mechatronic solutions are presented which can tackle current clinical problems associated with implanting an artificial muscle controlled by the nervous system. Progress depends on the improvement of the actuation properties of the elastomer, seamless or wireless integration between the nervous system and the artificial muscle, and on reducing the foreign body response.

	abstract     = {A growing interest within the space community focuses on robotics due to the large number of possible applications in many mission scenarios. On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) is arguably the most appealing implementation of space automatic systems. In several cases, OOS requires the capture of orbital objects, which is a complex and risky operation that can be successfully performed by robotic manipulators. Soft robotics, in particular, seems to be suitable for such applications given its intrinsic compliance to the operative environment. Devices based on Dielectric Elastomers (DE) can be employed for the implementation of soft robotic systems and showed promising performances. The introduction of DEs to orbital systems would represent a breakthrough in space technologies. In addition, space conditions could further advantage DE robotics, given the reduced environmental loads experienced and the longer times for operations. Nevertheless, Dielectric Elastomer Actuators (DEA) are a low-TRL (Technology Readiness Level) technology that needs to prove its maturity and suitability to space implementation. In this work, the performances of a redundant manipulator based on DEAs are presented in terms of numerical and experimental results. A 4-DoF planar manipulator has been tested in a gravity-compensated setup. The system is composed by two double-cone actuators mounted in series, each of them providing actuation of two DoF. The end-effector is an optical marker whose position is detected by a vision system. The system has a total of four joint DoF and operates in the xy horizontal plane; only the x and y positions of the end-effector are controlled. Two degrees of redundancy are obtained and exploited for the optimization of joint torques to avoid the saturation of actuators. Numerical simulations have been conducted to predict the system behaviour. The laboratory facility emulates the zero-gravity orbital environment by means of a suspending cable. Detailed experimental results are presented and exploited for the validation of control algorithm and numerical models.},

Several advantages of soft robots over rigid robots are safe human interaction, ease of adaptation with wearable electronics and simpler gripping. We review design factors of soft robots including modeling, controls, actuation, fabrication and application, as well as their limitations and future work. For modeling, we survey kinematic, multibody and numerical finite element methods. Finite element methods are better suited for the analysis of soft robots, since they can accurately model nonlinearities in geometry and materials. However, their real-time integration with controls is challenging. We categorize the controls of soft robots as model-based and model-free. Model-free controllers do not rely on an explicit analytical or numerical model of the soft robot to perform actuation. Actuation is the ability to exert a force using actuators such as shape memory alloys, fluid gels, elastomers and piezoelectrics. Nonlinear geometry and materials of soft robots restrict using conventional rigid body controls. The fabrication techniques used for soft robots differ significantly from that of rigid robots. We survey a wide range of techniques used for fabrication of soft robots from simple molding to more advanced additive manufacturing methods such as 3D printing. We discuss the applications and limitations of biomedical soft robots covering aspects such as functionality, ease of use and cost.

To estimate joint motions from such sensors, previous studies have modelled relationships between the sensor strains and motion parameters via supervised/semi-supervised learning. However, typically these only model a single relationship assuming the sensor to be located at a specific point on the body. Consequently, they exhibit reduced performance when the strain-parameter relationship varies due to sensor shifts caused by long-term wearing or donning/doffing of braces. This letter presents a shift-adaptive estimation of knee joint angle. First, a brace is instrumented with two stretch sensors placed at different heights. Next, the different strain-angle relationships at varying brace shift positions are learned using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). The system then estimates the joint angle from the sensor strains through Gaussian mixture regression using a maximum likelihood shift GMM, which is identified by referring to the two strains in a previous 1 s period. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method estimates the joint angle at multiple shift positions (0-20 mm) with higher accuracy than methods using a single model, single sensor, or referring to the present sensor strains.},

Nevertheless, traditional approaches to enhancing data-driven studies in this domain often face challenges, primarily due to privacy concerns in sensitive healthcare environments. Federated Learning rises as the solution to the problem, as it not only improves the model learning ability but also protects the data privacy. In this paper, we proposed a Federated Learning Human Posture Recognition (FL-HPR) framework according to image and point cloud fusion. FL-HPR significantly enhances the information flow in the global model while ensuring the data privacy in local models, the benefits highlight the framework's potential in sensitive applications. Furthermore, the key innovation of FL-HPR is the optimization of the local dynamic graph edge convolution network of robot, which improves the recognition accuracy of individual body limb and enhance overall robustness. Experiments on Non-IID datasets illustrate that the presented FL-HPR remarkably outperforms non-federated learning methods, suggesting its potential to improve the accuracy of human joint estimation. The breakthrough indicates that the proposed FL-HPR can be integrated into the intelligent nursing robot in practical applications.

Patients affected by stroke may be able to regain strength and functionality of their limbs through rehabilitation. However, the time a patient spends with a physiotherapist or occupational therapist is limited due to cost, time, and resource restraints. With the expected increase in the number of people affected by stroke, it may be more difficult to provide each patient with the full support they need for better recovery.

		A hybrid assist-as-need exoskeleton has the potential to enhance rehabilitation and meet the healthcare and economic demands due to stroke. Automated assistance means a patient can require less time guided by a physiotherapist or occupational therapist, and the exercise frequency can be increased. Hybrid assistance, utilising both an actuator and functional electrical stimulation, can combine the benefits of an actuator and FES, allow for rehabilitation that suits a patient’s needs, and allow for fatigue to be effectively managed to extend the exercise duration. Assist-as-need control sets the assistance according to the patient’s capabilities to encourage active participation, which promotes neuroplasticity and can lead to improved recovery from stroke.

However, VR applications need to track the location of the user in real-world space, which is hard to obtain using only inertial sensors. In this paper, we present Fusion Poser, which combines the deep learning-based pose estimation and location tracking method with six inertial measurement units and a head tracking sensor that provides head-mounted displays. To estimate human poses, we propose a bidirectional recurrent neural network with a convolutional long short-term memory layer that achieves higher accuracy and stability by preserving spatio-temporal properties. To locate a user with real-world coordinates, our method integrates the results of an estimated joint pose with the pose of the tracker. To train the model, we gathered public motion capture datasets of synthesized IMU measurement data, as well as creating a real-world dataset. In the evaluation, our method showed higher accuracy and a more robust estimation performance, especially when the user adopted lower poses, such as a squat or a bow.},

Skin mechanical properties have been proposed to account for these differences; however, a direct relationship between foot sole afferent firing, perceptual threshold, and skin mechanical properties has not been previously investigated. Using the technique of microneurography, we recorded the monofilament firing thresholds of cutaneous afferents and associated perceptual thresholds across the foot sole. In addition, receptive field hardness measurements were taken to investigate the influence of skin hardness on these threshold measures. Afferents were identified as fast adapting [FAI (n=48) or FAII (n=13)] or slowly adapting [SAI (n=21) or SAII (n=20)], and were grouped based on receptive field location (heel, arch, metatarsals, toes). Overall, perceptual thresholds were found to most closely align with firing thresholds of FA afferents. In contrast, SAI and SAII afferent firing thresholds were found to be significantly higher than perceptual thresholds and are not thought to mediate monofilament perceptual threshold across the foot sole. Perceptual thresholds and FAI afferent firing thresholds were significantly lower in the arch compared with other regions, and skin hardness was found to positively correlate with both FAI and FAII afferent firing and perceptual thresholds. These data support a perceptual influence of skin hardness, which is likely the result of elevated FA afferent firing threshold at harder foot sole sites. The close coupling between FA afferent firing and perceptual threshold across foot sole indicates that small changes in FA afferent firing can influence perceptual thresholds.},

Despite of similar aspect ratios the electrical percolation behaviour was different. TEM investigations reveal significant differences in the nanotube dispersion which can be attributed to different dispersability of the raw MWNT materials. It is shown that the investigation of the sedimentation behaviour of aqueous MWNT dispersions is a simple method to estimate the nanotube dispersability. The relationships between melt processing conditions and MWNT dispersion and distribution were studied on polycarbonate samples containing 0.875 wt% MWNT prepared by masterbatch dilution. During melt mixing only high shear forces can provide suitable MWNT dispersion because firstly the MWNT disentanglement is facilitated and secondly secondary agglomeration is prevented. At low shear agglomeration of formerly well dispersed MWNT could be observed. During hot pressing the network or MWNT arrangement and the resulting electrical conductivity can be manipulated by the processing conditions like melt temperature and pressing speed. A certain nanotube agglomeration can enhance the development of an electrical percolated network as shown by dielectric spectroscopy. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

After mixing cellulose nanofiber into these dispersions, vertically aligned carbon nanotubes/graphene network foams were prepared using an ice-template assembly method, to which liquid silicone rubber was filled to obtain carbon nanotubes/graphene/silicone rubber composites. Polymethylhydrosiloxane was grafted with 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate and the resultant copolymer was used as a coupling agent to improve interface interaction between silicone rubber and filler. With increasing carbon nanotubes content, the electrical conductivities of the foams and composites increased. The composite prepared with 4 g CNT and 1 g graphene aqueous dispersions had the conductive percolation threshold of 0.08% and exhibited high conductivity at low filler content. The addition of the copolymer increased the compressive strength of the composites. The composite prepared with 1 g CNT and 4 g graphene aqueous dispersions was encapsulated in an insole as a piezoresistor to effectively detect the number of pedestrian steps, and had a stable output of electrical signal.

This novel and flexible microstructural modeling method enables us to virtually investigate the morphology of conductive additives within a polymer matrix and can be adapted to many conductive polymer combinations used for different applications. Furthermore, we calculate the electrical conductivity of the composite using a finite volume-based as well as a discrete element-based simulation technique and validate the results with experimental data. Utilizing a novel discrete element method (DEM) modeling technique, we were able to improve calculation times by a factor of 12.2 compared to finite volume method (FVM) simulations while maintaining high accuracy.

First, frequently used piezoresistive materials and microstructures are introduced in which various strategies to improve sensor performance are presented. Second, pressure sensor arrays with spatial distribution perception capability are discussed emphatically. Crosstalk is a particular concern for sensor arrays, where mechanical and electrical sources of crosstalk issues and the corresponding solutions are highlighted. Third, several processing methods are also introduced, classified as printing, field-assisted and laser-assisted fabrication.

Social robots would benefit from whole-body robotic skin (or tactile sensors) resembling human skin in realizing a safe, intuitive, and contact-rich human-robot interaction. However, existing soft tactile sensors show several drawbacks (complex structure, poor scalability, and fragility), which limit their application in whole-body robotic skin. Here, we introduce biomimetic robotic skin based on hydrogel-elastomer hybrids and tomographic imaging. The developed skin consists of a tough hydrogel and a silicone elastomer forming a skin-inspired multilayer structure, achieving sufficient softness and resilience for protection. The sensor structure can also be easily repaired with adhesives even after severe damage (incision). For multimodal tactile sensation, electrodes and microphones are deployed in the sensor structure to measure local resistance changes and vibration due to touch. The ionic hydrogel layer is deformed owing to an external force, and the resulting local conductivity changes are measured via electrodes. The microphones also detect the vibration generated from touch to determine the location and type of dynamic tactile stimuli. The measurement data are then converted into multimodal tactile information through tomographic imaging and deep neural networks. We further implement a sensorized cosmetic prosthesis, demonstrating that our design could be used to implement deformable or complex-shaped robotic skin.},

The electrical measurement method is the most widely investigated; however, it is unsuitable for microfluidic systems because of a complicated fabrication process and difficult integration. Moreover, it is generally damaged by large deflection. This paper proposes a thin-film-based pressure sensor that is free from these limitations, using a liquid metal called galinstan. The proposed pressure sensor is easily integrated into a microfluidic system using soft lithography because galinstan exists in a liquid phase at room temperature. We investigated the characteristics of the proposed pressure sensor by calibrating for a pressure range from 0 to 230 kPa (R2 > 0.98) using deionized water. Furthermore, the viscosity of various fluid samples was measured for a shear-rate range of 30–1000 s−1. The results of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids were evaluated using a commercial viscometer and normalized difference was found to be less than 5.1% and 7.0%, respectively. The  galinstan-based pressure sensor can be used in various microfluidic systems for long-term monitoring with high linearity, repeatability, and long-term stability.},

Recent advances in electronics, materials, and mechanical designs have offered avenues toward wearable HMI devices. However, existing wearable HMI devices are uncomfortable to use and restrict the human body’s motion, show slow response times, or are challenging to realize with multiple functions. Here, we report sol-gel-on-polymer–processed indium zinc oxide semiconductor nanomembrane–based ultrathin stretchable electronics with advantages of multifunctionality, simple manufacturing, imperceptible wearing, and robust interfacing. Multifunctional wearable HMI devices range from resistive random-access memory for data storage to field-effect transistors for interfacing and switching circuits, to various sensors for health and body motion sensing, and to microheaters for temperature delivery. The HMI devices can be not only seamlessly worn by humans but also implemented as prosthetic skin for robotics, which offer intelligent feedback, resulting in a closed-loop HMI system.},

Tactile sensing and texture recognition is important for controlled manipulation of objects and navigating in one's environment. Yet, providing robotic systems or prosthetic devices with such capability at high density and bandwidth remains challenging. Each sensor node in the presented skin is created by collocating computational elements with individual microphones. These nodes are networked in a lattice and embedded in EcoFlex rubber, forming an amorphous medium. Unlike existing skins consisting of passive sensor arrays that feed into a central computer, our approach allows for detecting, conditioning and processing of tactile signals in-skin, facilitating the use of high-bandwidth signals, such as vibration, and allowing nodes to respond only to signals of interest. Communication between nodes allows the skin to localize the source of a stimulus, such as rubbing or slip, in a decentralized manner. Signal processing by individual nodes allows the skin to estimate the material touched. Combining these two capabilities, the skin is able to convert high-bandwidth, spatiotemporal information into low-bandwidth, event-driven information. Unlike taxel-based sensing arrays, this amorphous approach greatly reduces the computational load on the central robotic system. We describe the design, analysis, construction, instrumentation and programming of the robotic skin. We demonstrate that a 2.8 square meter skin with 10 sensing nodes is capable of localizing stimulus to within 2 centimeters, and that an individual sensing node can identify 15 textures with an accuracy of 71%. Finally, we discuss how such a skin could be used for full-body sensing in existing robots, augment existing sensing modalities, and how this material may be useful in robotic grasping tasks.},

Although our aim is to give an understanding of latchup as it occurs in CMOS switches, similar principles apply to many other CMOS devices. Latchup may be defined as the creation of a low-impedance path between power supply rails as a result of triggering a parasitic device. In this condition, excessive current flow is possible, and a potentially destructive situation exists. After even a very short period of time in this condition, the device in which it occurs can be destroyed or weakened; and potential damage can occur to other components in the system. Latchup may be caused by a number of triggering factors, to be discussed below—including overvoltage spikes or transients, exceeding maximum ratings, and incorrect power sequencing.}

Measurements of the dependence on frequency of the AC conductivity of carbon black-polyethylene composites, at different loadings and at different temperatures, are performed. They yield experimental evidence of a change of connectivity of the conducting network during heating near the melting temperature of polyethylene.

In the future, active, sustainable and lightweight building skins are needed to serve as an adaptive interface to govern the building-physical interactions between these two worlds. This article provides conceptual and experimental results regarding the integration of ionic electroactive polymer sensors and actuators into fabric membranes. The ultimate goal is to use this technology for adaptive membrane building skins. These devices have attracted high interest from industry and academia due to their small actuation voltages, relatively large actuation and sensing responses and their flexible and soft mechanical characteristics. However, their complex manufacturing process, sophisticated material compositions and their environmental sensitivity have limited the application range until now. The article describes the potentials and limitations of employing such devices for two different adaptive building functionalities: first, as a means of ventilation control and humidity regulation by embedding small actuated apertures into a fabric membrane, and second, as flexible, energy- and cost-efficient distributed sensors for external load monitoring of such structures. The article focusses on designing, building and testing two experimental membrane demonstrators with integrated polymer actuators and sensors. It addresses the challenges encountered and draws conclusions for potential future optimization at the device and system level.},

	abstract     = {Background: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) during repetitive practice of everyday tasks can facilitate recovery of upper limb function following stroke. Reduction in impairment is strongly associated with how closely FES assists performance, with advanced iterative learning control (ILC) technology providing precise upper-limb assistance. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of extending ILC technology to control FES of three muscle groups in the upper limb to facilitate functional motor recovery post-stroke. Methods. Five stroke participants with established hemiplegia undertook eighteen intervention sessions, each of one hour duration. During each session FES was applied to the anterior deltoid, triceps, and wrist/finger extensors to assist performance of functional tasks with real-objects, including closing a drawer and pressing a light switch. Advanced model-based ILC controllers used kinematic data from previous attempts at each task to update the FES applied to each muscle on the subsequent trial. This produced stimulation profiles that facilitated accurate completion of each task while encouraging voluntary effort by the participant. Kinematic data were collected using a Microsoft Kinect, and mechanical arm support was provided by a SaeboMAS. Participants completed Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test clinical assessments pre- and post-intervention, as well as FES-unassisted tasks during each intervention session. Results: Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test scores both significantly improved from pre- to post-intervention by 4.4 points. Improvements were also found in FES-unassisted performance, and the amount of arm support required to successfully perform the tasks was reduced. Conclusions: This feasibility study indicates that technology comprising low-cost hardware fused with advanced FES controllers accurately assists upper limb movement and may reduce upper limb impairments following stroke. © 2014 Meadmore et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Model-based FES controllers have recently confirmed significant potential to improve accuracy of functional reaching tasks, but they typically require a reference trajectory to track. Few upper-limb FES control schemes embed a computational model of the task; however, this is critical to ensure the controller reinforces the intended movement with high accuracy. This paper derives computational motor control models of functional tasks that can be directly embedded in real-time FES control schemes, removing the need for a predefined reference trajectory. Dynamic models of the electrically stimulated arm are first derived, and constrained optimisation problems are formulated to encapsulate common activities of daily living. These are solved using iterative algorithms, and results are compared with kinematic data from 12 subjects and found to fit closely (mean fitting between 63.2% and 84.0%). The optimisation is performed iteratively using kinematic variables and hence can be transformed into an iterative learning control algorithm by replacing simulation signals with experimental data. The approach is therefore capable of controlling FES in real time to assist tasks in a manner corresponding to unimpaired natural movement. By ensuring that assistance is aligned with voluntary intention, the controller hence maximises the potential effectiveness of future stroke rehabilitation trials.},

In this work, the effects of corrosion rate on the rheological properties of MREs are experimentally investigated. The CIPs undergo an accelerated corrosion test in diluted hydrochloric (HCl) acid at various concentrations, particularly at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 vol.% for 30 min immersion time, individually. Four samples of CIPs, including the non-corroded one are prepared, and their morphological characterization are observed via field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), that equipped with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) for elemental compositions. In addition, x-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to identify the crystalline phase structure of the samples. In order to examine the corrosion rate of each sample, weight-loss method is used by pressing the CIPs into pellet shape and being immersed in the respective concentrations of HCl. It is shown that the corrosion rate of CIPs is increased with the increasing of HCl concentration in which higher weight loss of the measured pallet CIPs is observed. Meanwhile, the field-dependent rheological properties of MREs are investigated via rheometer to analyze the change in dynamic modulus of MREs such as storage modulus, loss factor and absolute MR effect. These experimental results indicate that MRE samples with higher corrosion rate of CIP exhibit lower storage modulus, loss factor and MR effect, as this subsequently would deteriorate the performance of MRE. Therefore, it is identified that the purity of CIP plays the most important contribution towards the field-dependent viscoelastic properties of MRE for a long period use of the material.},

	abstract     = {Magnetorheological elastomer (MRE) composite actuators are extraordinary since they can be controlled remotely, move swiftly, adapt to rough surfaces, and engage with humans in a secure manner. Despite all these advantages, pure MREs are not stable enough because of their high degree of softness. Also, a magnetic field is always required to actuate and hold them in the required position accordingly. This paper offers a new conceptual design for bi-stable MRE-based electroactive composite actuators with high performance. The idea is a combination of MRE composites and 4D printing (4DP) of conductive shape memory polymers. The silicone resins are loaded with strontium ferrite magnetic particles and a thin conductive carbon black polylactic acid (CPLA) is 4D printed and embedded as a core inside the composite. A set of parametric studies is carried out to examine the material properties, 4DP characteristics, and magnetization conditions. As an outcome, a functional, lightweight, and bi-stable composite actuator with programmable magnetic patterns is developed. This actuator can be positioned in the actuated situation without any stimuli as long as required. The shape memory behaviour, bi-directionality, and remote controlling of the composite actuator are driven by Joule heating and magnetic fields. The actuator with a weight of 1.47 g can hold and lift weights up to 200 g. Finally, experiments are conducted to demonstrate the immense potential of the developed composite actuators as mechanical and biomedical devices. Due to the absence of similar concepts and results in the specialized literature, this paper is likely to advance the state-of-the-art smart composite actuators with remotely controlled shape-memory features.},

	abstract     = {Piezoresistivity is an electromechanical effect characterized by the reversible change in the electrical resistivity with strain. It is useful for electrical-resistance-based strain/stress sensing. The resistivity can be the volumetric, interfacial or surface resistivity, though the volumetric resistivity is most meaningful scientifically. Because the irreversible resistivity change (due to damage or an irreversible microstructural change) adds to the reversible change that occurs at lower strains, the inclusion of the irreversible effect makes the piezoresistivity appear stronger than the inherent effect. This paper focuses on the inherent piezoresistivity that occurs without irreversible resistivity changes. The effect is described by the gage factor (GF), which is defined as the fractional change in resistance per unit strain. The GF can be positive or negative. Strong piezoresistivity involves the magnitude of the fractional change in resistivity much exceeding the strain magnitude. The reversible effect of strain on the electrical connectivity is the primary piezoresistivity mechanism. Giant piezoresistivity is characterized by GF ≥ 500. This critical review with 209 references covers the theory, mechanisms, methodology and status of piezoresistivity, and provides the first review of the emerging field of giant piezoresistivity. Piezoresistivity is exhibited by electrically conductive materials, particularly metals, carbons and composite materials with conductive fillers and nonconductive matrices. They include functional and structural materials. Piezoresistivity enables structural materials to be self-sensing. Unfortunately, GF was incorrectly or unreliably reported in a substantial fraction of the publications, due to the pitfalls systematically presented here. The most common pitfall involves using the two-probe method for the resistance measurement.},

In particular, in liquid metal, this is one of the ways to produce metal-matrix composites reinforced with micron and nano sized particles. The associated mechanism through which the de-agglomeration occurs has, however, only been conceptualized theoretically and not yet been validated with experimental observations. In this paper, the influence of ultrasonic cavitation on SiO2 and MgO agglomerates (commonly found in lightweight alloys as reinforcements) with individual particle sizes ranging between 0.5 and 10 μm was observed for the first time in-situ using high-speed imaging. Owing to the opacity of liquid metals, a de-agglomeration imaging experiment was carried out in de-ionised water with sequences captured at frame rates up to 50 kfps. In-situ observations were further accompanied by synchronised acoustic measurements using an advanced calibrated cavitometer, to reveal the effect of pressure amplitude arising from oscillating microbubbles on oxide de-agglomeration. Results showed that ultrasound-induced microbubble clusters pulsating chaotically, were predominantly responsible for the breakage and dispersion of oxide agglomerates. Such oscillating cavitation clusters were seen to capture the floating agglomerates resulting in their immediate disintegration. De-agglomeration of oxides occurred from both the surface and within the bulk of the aggregate. Microbubble clusters oscillating with associated emission frequencies at the subharmonic, 1st harmonic and low order ultra-harmonics of the driving frequency were deemed responsible for the breakage of the agglomerates.},

	abstract     = {Liquid metal (LM) with high electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, excellent biocompatibility, and extraordinary fluidity has emerged as a promising class of functional materials. However, such materials still encounter many practical challenges due to the rather limited forms available so far. As a promising remedy, LM composites in synergy with other materials would open tremendous opportunities for fundamental research or practical applications. This is because controllable integration of base LM with functional materials (e.g., metal nanoparticles, polymers, and drug molecules) would significantly tune the intrinsic properties of LM as desired, enabling it to offer further major potential in tackling various sectors' challenging issues, including thermal management, biomedicine, chemical catalysis, flexible electronics, and soft robots. Here, we systematically summarize and review the fundamental progress in pursuing LM composites. The basic composite strategies are outlined in three categories: LM composites with core-shell structure, LM-polymer composites, and LM-particle composites. The effectiveness of the composite strategy is illustrated via the typical applications of LM composites in representative fields. The challenges and perspectives in developing LM composites are also identified and interpreted to better guide future research. It is expected that the coming LM era will witness a new world of fruitful composites thereby discovered or invented. Liquid metal, a newly emerging cutting-edge functional material in many scientific and technological frontiers, is nurturing a revolution in both fundamental discovery and unconventional applications. However, pure liquid metal or its alloy would encounter a practical bottleneck when applied to tackle various needs because of currently available limited physical or chemical properties. As an important alternative, liquid metal composite would help resolve such a challenge, because targeted material thus enabled can be designed through integrating liquid metal with many different matching materials such as nanoparticles and polymers. In fact, composites have played the major role in developing new materials, and composite strategy often serves as the cornerstone in material properties innovation. With the increasing endeavors of academics, liquid metal composites have gradually caught the eye of researchers, and some landmark advances have been made. It is very clear that there is currently an urgent need to further push forward research in this direction. This article presents a systematic interpretation of composite strategies, aiming to help find ever advanced LM composites. In particular, we summarize for the first time the progress made on LM composites over the past few years and propose three main composite strategies to better guide future research. This review summarizes the development of liquid metal composites, and for the first time proposes three major compound strategies for the preparation of liquid metal composites, which are verified by their applications in different fields.},

However, there is still a lack of suitable materials for inkjet-printed electrodes.

As the same procedure can be applied over all the heat-treatment temperature range, the determination of band parameters from five band decompositions appears to be the most convenient to follow the CB's structural improvement. We demonstrate that only a partial graphitization takes place and the graphitizability is limited by the diameter of the primary particles.

Therefore, systematic cyclic tensile tests are performed with carbon black-filled silicone yarns, which show that the non-monotonic behavior found depends on strain rate, strain history, and maximum applied strain. Based on the experimental results, a novel model is developed that incorporates the visco-elastic nature of the polymer and representations of the percolative networks in strain direction as well as the transversal direction. It is shown that the non-monotonic behavior is a result of the combination of visco-elasticity and transversal contraction of the percolative network. The model is an equivalent circuit model and its simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results. The model can be used to further understand the strain sensing behavior of conductive polymers and optimize sensor systems.},

	abstract     = {The temperature dependence of mechanical properties of two families of toughened silicone resins was investigated. The first family was representative of hydrosilylation reaction curable silicone resins, and the second representative of condensation reaction curable ones. The hydrosilylation curable resin was cross-linked with a variety of cross-linkers, including 1,4-bis(dimethylsilyl) benzene, 1,1,3,3,5,5,-hexamethyltrisiloxane, diphenylsilane, and their mixtures. The condensation reaction curable resin and its toughened versions were cross-linked by silanol condensation. Properties studied included flexural strength, flexural modulus, and fracture toughness KIc,c. Temperature effect on these properties of the first family of resins was substantial and varied strongly with the type of cross-linkers. For this family of resins the flexural strength and modulus decreased with a rising temperature. Fracture toughness KIc showed a peaking behavior with the peak appearing at approximately 62°C below the a transition peak. This was explained by the effect of the plastic zone size, and the effect of the network resistance to plastic deformation. The second family of resins also showed decreases in modulus and strength with a higher testing temperature, but the fracture toughness changed little with temperature. © 2005 Society of Plastics Engineers.},

Elastomeric microstructures are commonly required to fulfil an explicit mechanical role and accordingly their mechanical properties can critically affect device performance. The mechanical properties of elastomers are known to vary with both curing and operational temperatures. However, even for the elastomer most commonly employed in microfluidic applications, Sylgard 184, only a very limited range of data exists regarding the variation in mechanical properties of bulk PDMS with curing temperature. We report an investigation of the variation in the mechanical properties of bulk Sylgard 184 with curing temperature, over the range 25 °C to 200 °C. PDMS samples for tensile and compressive testing were fabricated according to ASTM standards. Data obtained indicates variation in mechanical properties due to curing temperature for Young's modulus of 1.32-2.97 MPa, ultimate tensile strength of 3.51-7.65 MPa, compressive modulus of 117.8-186.9 MPa and ultimate compressive strength of 28.4-51.7 GPa in a range up to 40% strain and hardness of 44-54 ShA. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

A single sensor functions as a proximity detector; two can be used as a mouse; three allow tracking of the hand in three dimensions, and each additional sensor allows us to extract additional shape information. The ultimate goal of this work is to understand the entire hierarchy, from a single sensor up to an array of sensors. In this thesis, we take the rst steps toward imaging, moving from simple proximity detection to imaging a single point in three dimensions. At every step along the hierarchy, we are interested in two questions: i) given a xed number of sensors, how should they be arranged in space to enable us to extract the most information, and ii) given an arrangement of sensors, how should we infer \what's out there" from the data they return? We describe a probabilistic framework that can be used to answer these questions for any sensor conguration, from a single sensor to an array. The thesis describes the physics of Electric Field Sensing, uses this discussion to nd an approximate analytical solution to the forward problem of determining the sensor values from a conductivity distribution, shows how to use this analytical model in conjunction with probability theory to design optimal electrode layouts, and presents several methods of inverting the signals to recover information about a conductivity distribution from sensor values. As an example application, we present a non-contact three-dimensional mouse.},

	abstract     = {The physical user interface is an increasingly significant factor limiting the effectiveness of our interactions with and through technology. This thesis introduces Electric Field Imaging, a new physical channel and inference framework for machine perception of human action. Though electric eld sensing is an important sensory modality for several species of sh, it has not been seriously explored as a channel for machine perception. Technological applications of eld sensing, from the Theremin to the capacitive elevator button, have been limited to simple proximity detection tasks. This thesis presents a solution to the inverse problem of inferring geometrical information about the conguration and motion of the human body from electric eld measurements. It also presents simple, inexpensive hardware and signal processing techniques for making the eld measurements, and several new applications of electric eld sensing. The signal processing contribution includes synchronous undersampling, a narrowband, phase sensitive detection technique that is well matched to the capabilities of contemporary microcontrollers. In hardware, the primary contributions are the School of Fish, a scalable network of microcontroller-based transceive electrodes, and the LazyFish, a small footprint integrated sensing board. Connecting n School of Fish electrodes results in an array capable of making heterodyne measurements of any or all n(n  1) o-diagonal entries in the capacitance matrix. The LazyFish uses synchronous undersampling to provide up to 8 high signal-to-noise homodyne measurements in a very small package. The inverse electrostatics portion of the thesis presents a fast, general method for extracting geometrical information about the conguration and motion of the human body from eld measurements. The method is based on the Sphere Expansion, a novel fast method for generating approximate solutions to the Laplace equation. Finally, the thesis describes a variety of applications of electric eld sensing, many enabled by the small footprint of the LazyFish. To demonstrate the School of Fish hardware and the Sphere Expansion inversion method, the thesis presents 3 dimensional position and orientation tracking of two hands.},

In spite of its importance, the 3D-EIT has not been realized in lung monitoring because it has many design challenges such as noises incurred by complicated wiring, long cable length, wide variation in electrode contact and signal, and large personal-to-person impedance variation. In this paper, we present a portable 3D-EIT SoC for real-time lung ventilation monitoring with following 5 features: 1) The active electrodes (AEs) system to reduce coupling noise, 2) High output impedance current stimulator to inject stable current, 3) Impedance spectroscopy to enable both time-difference (TD) EIT and frequency-difference (FD) EIT, and to select an optimal frequency for TD-EIT, 4) Wide-dynamic range front-end circuit to detect variable ranges of signal with high-input impedance and CMRR, 5) Calibration to reduce the electrical characteristics variations of AEs.}

EIT aims to recover the internal distribution of electrical conductivity inside the target. The inverse problem underlying the EIT image formation task is nonlinear and severely ill-posed, and hence sensitive to modeling errors and measurement noise. Therefore, the inversion process needs to be regularized. However, traditional variational regularization methods, based on optimization, often suffer from local minima because of nonlinearity. This is what makes regularized direct (non-iterative) methods attractive for EIT. The most developed direct EIT algorithm is the D-bar method, based on complex geometric optics solutions and a nonlinear Fourier transform. Variants and recent developments of D-bar methods are reviewed, and their practical numerical implementation is explained.},

Although intrinsically conductive polymers such as polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline have emerged as lucrative candidates, they are extremely limited in their processability by conventional solution-based approaches. In this work, ultrathin nanostructured coatings of doped PPy are realized on polyurethane films of different architectures via oxidative chemical vapor deposition to develop stretchable and flexible resistance-based strain sensors. Holding the substrates perpendicular to the reactant flows facilitates diffusive transport and ensures excellent conformality of the interfacial integrated PPy coatings throughout the 3D porous electrospun fiber mats in a single step. This allows the mechanically robust (stretchability > 400%, with fatigue resistance up to 1000 cycles) nanocomposites to elicit a reversible change of electrical resistance when subjected to consecutive cycles of stretching and releasing. The repeatable performance of the strain sensor is linear due to dimensional changes of the conductive network in the low-strain regime (ϵ ≤ 50%), while the evolution of nano-cracks leads to an exponential increase, which is observed in the high-strain regime, recording a gauge factor as high as 46 at 202% elongational strain. The stretchable conductive polymer nanocomposites also show biocompatibility toward human dermal fibroblasts, thus providing a promising path for use as piezoresistive strain sensors and finding applications in biomedical applications such as wearable, skin-mountable flexible electronics.},

However, due to the intrinsic limitations of low stretchability and large hysteresis, existing strain sensors cannot fully exploit their potential when used in wearable or robotic systems. Here, a conducting polymer hydrogel strain sensor exhibiting both ultimate strain (300%) and negligible hysteresis (<1.5%) is presented. This is achieved through a unique microphase semiseparated network design by compositing poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) nanofibers with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and facile fabrication by combining 3D printing and successive freeze-thawing. The overall superior performances of the strain sensor including stretchability, linearity, cyclic stability, and robustness against mechanical twisting and pressing are systematically characterized. The integration and application of such strain sensor with electronic skins are further demonstrated to measure various physiological signals, identify hand gestures, enable a soft gripper for objection recognition, and remote control of an industrial robot. This work may offer both promising conducting polymer hydrogels with enhanced sensing functionalities and technical platforms toward stretchable electronic skins and intelligent robotic systems.},

A robust chemical bonding and a reliable encapsulation approach are introduced to overcome detachment and water-evaporation issues in hydrogel biosensors. The resultant GelMA tactile sensor shows a high-pressure sensitivity of 0.19 kPa−1 and one order of magnitude lower limit of detection (0.1 Pa) compared to previous hydrogel pressure sensors owing to its excellent mechanical and electrical properties (dielectric constant). Furthermore, it shows durability up to 3000 test cycles because of tough chemical bonding, and long-term stability of 3 days due to the inclusion of an encapsulation layer, which prevents water evaporation (80% water content). Successful monitoring of various human physiological and motion signals demonstrates the potential of these GelMA tactile sensors for wearable biosensing applications.},

This study reports extrinsically developed conductive textiles by realizing in-situ polymerization of polyaniline across warp knitted 4-way stretch textiles enveloped in waterborne polyurethane coatings. As developed textiles not only acquire the required properties but also high sensitivity over a wide range of strain variations. As developed sensing structures exhibited remarkable mechanical robustness, long cycles life under varied strains and reproducible piezoresistive behavior both for subtle and blatant body movements. These breathable textile structures can be integrated into routine clothing using various integration techniques. The wash fastness, perspiration fastness and other textile related properties have been evaluated for practical usage. To demonstrate its real-time applications, a PCB and several body part artifacts have been designed such as arm sleeve, hand glove and knee cover with sensing elements for tracking, recording and identification of various motions and gestures.

The authors aimed to estimate the incidence, prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) of spinal cord injury (SCI) by location, sex, age, injury site and socio-demographic index (SDI) based on the data of the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019. Summary of Background Data. GBD 2019 estimates the burden of 369 diseases and injuries worldwide in 2019 and the temporal trends in the past 30 years. SCI is estimated as a result of injury from various causes. Methods. A Bayesian meta-regression tool, DisMod-MR2.1, was used to produce the estimates. Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated based on a linear regression mode of the age standardized rates and the calendar year to represent the temporal trends of the age standardized rates. Spearman rank order correlation was used to determine the correlation between SDI and the incidence and burden of SCI. Results. Globally, there were 0.9 [95% uncertainty interval (UI), 0.7 to 1.2] million incident cases, 20.6 (95% UI, 18.9-23.6) million prevalent cases and 6.2 (95% UI, 4.5-8.2) million YLDs of total SCI in 2019. The ASPR increased (EAPC, 0.1; 95% confidence interval, -0.01 to 0.2), while the age standardized incidence rate (ASIR) (EAPC, -0.08; 95% UI, -0.24 to 0.09) and age standardized YLD rate (ASYR) (EAPC, -0.08; 95% confidence interval, -0.24 to 0.09) decreased. Males had higher ASIR and ASYR, and the rate of incidence, prevalence and YLD increased with age. Spinal injuries at neck level caused higher ASYR than injuries below neck level. A positive correlation existed between SDI and ASIR (ρ=0.1626, P<0.05), while a negative correlation was observed between SDI and EAPC of ASYR (ρ=-0.2421, P<0.01). Conclusion. Conclusively, the incidence and burden of SCI has increased over the last 30 years. Males and the elderly were affected to a greater degree than females and younger individuals. Level of Evidence.

	abstract     = {Background: Traumatic amputation leads to disability and imposes a heavy health burden. This study aims to explore the current status and temporal trends of the global burden of traumatic amputation according to sex, age, amputation site, cause, and reginal level of social development. Methods: The data were extracted from the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) Study 2019. Prevalence, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs) and corresponding age-standardized rate were compared. Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was applied to reflect trends in age-standardized rates over a specific period. Spearman rank test and curve fitting methods were used to analyze the relationship between disease burden and Socio-Demographic Index (SDI). Results: Globally, the incidence and prevalence number of traumatic amputation increased from 11.37 million and 370.25 million in 1990, to 13.23 million and 552.45 million in 2019, with a raise of 16.4 and 49.2%, respectively. But the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) (EAPC = −0.56; 95%CI, −0.72 to −0.41) and age-standardize prevalence rate (ASPR) (EAPC = −0.63; 95%CI, −0.74 to −0.52) declined during this period. The YLDs count also increased by 39.2% globally (from 5.28 million to 7.35 million), while the age-standardize YLDs rate (ASYR) decreased by an average of 1.00% per year (95% CI, −1.10 to −0.90) from 1990 to 2019. The incidence, prevalence, and YLDs rate of traumatic amputation continue to increase with age. Traumatic amputations were most common in the fingers, while unilateral lower limb amputation caused the greatest burden of disability. ASIR and SDI were positively correlated (ρ = 0.442, p < 0.001), while ASYR and SDI were not significantly correlated (ρ = −0.030, p = 0.669), and EAPC in ASYR and SDI were negatively correlated (ρ = −0.275, p < 0.001). Exposure to mechanical forces and falls were the leading causes of traumatic amputation. Conclusion: Despite the declining trends in ASIR, ASPR, and ASYR, the incidence, prevalence, and YLDs counts of traumatic amputation have increased significantly worldwide, especially in the older adults population. With the population aging, targeted health policies are needed to address the increasing global burden of traumatic amputations in the future.},

These studies focus on the conditions to be imposed on the currents fed into the electrodes and on their measurement counterparts, while making use of various quantitative optimal criteria. While most EIT systems rely on a sequential excitation at neighboring electrodes with measurements at the remaining ones, some alternative excitation strategies, or protocols, have also proven to be effective and easy to implement using modern hardware. In this context, the present study aims at confronting some of the predominant EIT excitation protocols on a practical system that is dedicated to the imaging of media with highly contrasted material components, i.e. with large variations of the conductivity field. More specifically, the so-called adjacent, opposite, full-scan and trigonometric excitation strategies are considered here and assessed on a number of criteria, which are: complexity of a practical implementation, number of independent measurements, amplitude of the measured responses, sensitivity distribution and quality of the final reconstructed images. For each of these excitation protocols, numerical simulations and static experiments with test objects placed in the EIT sensor considered are carried out using various conductivity profiles, while reconstructed images are evaluated both qualitatively and qualitatively. Our results highlight the preeminence of the full-scan and trigonometric strategies, which are characterized by high response signals and satisfying overall sensitivities. Moreover, for the studied configurations in both numerical simulations and static experiments, the full scan and trigonometric strategies lead to improved contrasts in the reconstructed images of the phases distribution.},

A similar value of change of in‐phase shear modulus with strain amplitude (G′0 – G′∞) is found for a vulcanized and unvulcanized tire tread rubber; this behavior is attributed for the breakdown of the secondary three‐dimensional carbon black aggregated network. Detailed consideration is given to other factors such as hydrodynamic, shape factor, and relaxation effects which contribute to the difference between the shear modulus of the gum rubber and the filled rubber when all the carbon black structure has been broken down.

In particular, the results show how the stress softening and residual strain change with the magnitude of the applied strain. Then, on the basis of these data a constitutive model is derived to describe this behaviour. The theory of pseudo-elasticity is used for this model, the basis of which is the inclusion of two variables in the energy function in order separately to capture the stress softening and residual strain effects. The dissipation of energy, i.e. the difference between the energy input during loading and the energy returned on unloading is also accounted for in the model by the use of a dissipation function , which evolves with the deformation history. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Further the effect of repeated deformation is to cause rubber asymptotically to approach a steady state with a constant or equilibrium stress-strain curve. Softening in this way occurs in vulcanizates either with or without fillers although the effect appears to be much more pronounced in vulcanizates containing high proportions of reinforcing fillers. After the hardness test the simple extension stress-strain test is the test most widely used by rubber technologists. The conventional stress-strain curve is obtained on samples which have not been previously deformed and for design purpose the unique value of stiffness given by this curve may be of little significance. Thus it appears that the values of stress—strain properties determined after “conditioning” cycles of deformation would be of more practical use than the unique value obtained in the conventional test. In recent years much interest has been shown in the factors responsible for this softening behavior particularly in regard to the implications of the loss of the stiffening action of reinforcing fillers on the mechanism of reinforcement.},

	abstract     = {Soft materials often exhibit a distinctive power-law viscoelastic response arising from broad distribution of time-scales present in their complex internal structure. A promising tool to accurately describe the rheological behaviour of soft materials is fractional calculus. However, its use in the scientific community remains limited due to the unusual notation and non-trivial properties of fractional operators. This review aims to provide a clear and accessible description of fractional viscoelastic models for a broad audience and to demonstrate the ability of these models to deliver a unified approach for the characterisation of power-law materials. The use of a consistent framework for the analysis of rheological data would help classify the empirical behaviours of soft and biological materials, and better understand their response.},

The study of specific aging conditions relative to the electronics industry is proposed in this work, namely aging in a hermetic, initially inert atmosphere, at high temperatures. Viscoelastic properties of the materials are measured through DMA tests. Strain sweep tests are carried for the characterization of unaged materials, and frequency sweeps at ambient temperature are performed to characterize the aging-dependent behavior. As a result of the experimental studies, an aging-dependent generalized Maxwell model is proposed in an attempt to describe the evolution in the behavior of silicones due to aging.},

	abstract     = {Under dynamic loads, the viscoelastic behavior of filled elastomers exhibits a nonlinearity known as the Payne Effect. The material stiffness decreases as the dynamic strain amplitude increases. The aim of this work is to model this feature, by adapting a previously developed constitutive model. First, a complete experimental dynamic campaign is performed to characterize the dynamic properties of a filled elastomer used on silent block. The continuous spectrum of relaxation time is identified as a function of the strain amplitude. This identification follows the standard method of the literature. The spectrum is discretized into a dynamic strain amplitude dependent Prony Series. Finally, a constitutive model using the Prony Series is developed and numerically implemented. Comparisons between experimental results and model predictions are presented.},

	abstract     = {The power of energy storage devices is characterized by capacitance and the internal resistance. The capacitance is measured on an assumption that the charges are stored at the electrode interface and the electric double layer behaves like an ideal capacitor. However, in most cases, the electric double layer is not ideal so a constant phase element (CPE) is used instead of a capacitor to describe the practical observations. Nevertheless, another problem with the use of the CPE is that CPE does not give capacitance directly. Fortunately, a few methods were suggested to evaluate the effective capacitance in the literature. However, those methods may not be suitable for supercapacitors which are modeled as an equivalent circuit of a CPE and resistor connected in series because the time constant of the equivalent circuit is not clearly studied. In this report, in order to study the time constant of the CPE and find its equivalent capacitor, AC and DC methods are utilized in a complementary manner. As a result, the time constants in the AC and DC domains are compared with digital simulation and a proper equation is presented to calculate the effective capacitance of a supercapacitor, which is extended to an elec-trochemical system where faradaic and ohmic processes are accompanied by imperfect charge accumulation process.},

	abstract     = {Fractional calculus is a mathematical approach dealing with derivatives and integrals of arbitrary and complex orders. Therefore, it adds a new dimension to understand and describe basic nature and behavior of complex systems in an improved way. Here we use the fractional calculus for modeling electrical properties of biological systems. We derived a new class of generalized models for electrical impedance and applied them to human skin by experimental data fitting. The primary model introduces new generalizations of: 1) Weyl fractional derivative operator, 2) Cole equation, and 3) Constant Phase Element (CPE). These generalizations were described by the novel equation which presented parameter (β) related to remnant memory and corrected four essential parameters (R0,R∞,α,τα) We further generalized single generalized element by introducing specific partial sum of Maclaurin series determined by parameters (β*, γ, δ ...). We defined individual primary model elements and their serial combination models by the appropriate equations and electrical schemes. Cole equation is a special case of our generalized class of models for β* =γ=δ=...= 0. Previous bioimpedance data analyses of living systems using basic Cole and serial Cole models show significant imprecisions. Our new class of models considerably improves the quality of fitting, evaluated by mean square errors, for bioimpedance data obtained from human skin. Our models with new parameters presented in specific partial sum of Maclaurin series also extend representation, understanding and description of complex systems electrical properties in terms of remnant memory effects. © 2013 Vosika et al.},
