		Some of the world's most advanced technology is rigid due to various factors such as; manufacturability, miniaturisability, physical linearity, and more ideal linear physical mechanics. Rigid mechanisms were engineered first and have been refined to a high level, but now are encountering limitations leading to demand for soft robotic solutions that mimic biological evolution. This thesis develops and integrates an artificial skin and artificial muscle technology by combining of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), carbon black silicone rubber (CBSR) elastomer composites, and Dielectric Elastomer Actuators (DEAs) to enhance pressure mapping, strain sensing, and actuation capabilities.
		
		CBSR elastomer composites, noted for their high stretchability, piezoresistivity, and biocompatibility, were investigated to understand their non-linear time dependent phenomena in particular, resistance relaxation behavior. This research contributes to optimising the design of flexible dynamic strain sensors by modelling the response of resistance to transient strain inputs. The next part of the thesis describes development of an EIT-based pressure mapping system using a CBSR sensing domain that mimics pressure mapping qualities of human skin. This system was evaluated for its spatial and temporal resolution, showing potential for creating artificial pressure-sensitive skin with practical applications. At the core of this thesis the integration of EIT-based sensing with DEAs was tested and analysed to improve the mapping of compressive forces across the actuator electrode surfaces. Despite some trade-offs in accuracy due to electrode compliance, this approach offers promising advancements for applications requiring precise actuation and pressure mapping. This work has contributed towards filing a patent for an DEA-EIT actuator-sensor device. Additionally, the research has uncovered unintentional power generation in DEA-EIT systems through FEA studies and analytical validation, which could function as Dielectric Elastomer Generators (DEGs) with mapped compressive load inputs. This finding highlights the multi-functionality of DEAs and suggests opportunities for energy harvesting applications. To aid the portability of EIT-based pressure mapping sensor developed, a low-cost circuit and evaluation tools were developed. This system enables comprehensive characterisation of various sensing domains and supports advancements in EIT-based soft sensor technology, with implications for biomedical devices, robotics, and energy harvesting. 
		
		Overall, this research advances the field of soft sensors by integrating EIT with electroactive material and actuator technologies, providing new insights and applications in dynamic sensing and actuation.

		I'd like to thank many people who have implicitly and explicitly helped me get through my doctorate. Firstly, the UC Bioengineering office including the Lung Ladies, Lung lads, IPC, Hamish for infinite Friday beers, and Nic's abstract art. Also included in the office, Geoff Chase, for a constant stream of stories and advice always within earshot. The Mechanical Engineering post-grad office for baking, fruit, and comic relief. The UC Mechanical and Electrical department technicians for yarns and practical advice. All of the students I tutored and mentored, keeping me on my toes throughout the doctorate. Thanks for the motivation from all of my friends with the never ending question `so... when do you finish', a very motivating and difficult question answer. Something that prolonged the journey but kept me sane, were the technical the side jobs and fun adventures with colleagues and friends maintaining my sanity. A special thanks to my supervision and collaborations abroad, including my materials science work in IMDEA with Juan Jose and Anastasia and my time with with the MEiTNER soft robotics research group led by Markus Vorrath. Thanks to my internal supervision from Tim teaching me what PHD stands for and my co-supervisors Chris and Lui who have been a good source of advice, yarns, and general guidance. A thank you to my family for being supportive in times of strife. Finally, a big thanks to my partner Tess for her ongoing support and distractions from PhD work.
