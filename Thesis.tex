		Some of the world's most advanced technology is rigid due to various factors such as; manufacturability, miniaturisability, physical linearity, and more ideal physics in general. In parallel industries is also looking to use automation to improve and replace laborious tasks whether they be domestic, commercial, or industrially related tasks. Their is a growing need for new innovations in technology to utilise the soft robotic solutions that mimic biological solutions seen in nature. This thesis is part of many to improve an understanding of the electroactive polymer subset of soft robotics and the limitations of specific implementations of artificial skin and artificial muscle technologies.
		
		This thesis explores the integration of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), carbon black silicone rubber (CBSR) elastomer composites, and Dielectric Elastomer Actuators (DEAs) to enhance pressure mapping, strain sensing, and actuation capabilities.
		
		CBSR elastomer composites, noted for their high stretchability and biocompatibility, were investigated to understand their resistance relaxation behavior. This research contributes to optimising the design of flexible dynamic strain sensors by modeling the response of resistance to transient strain inputs. The next past of the work developed an EIT-based pressure mapping system using a CBSR sensing domain that mimics pressure mapping qualities of human skin. This system was evaluated for its spatial and temporal resolution, showing potential for creating artificial pressure-sensitive skin with practical applications. Furthermore, the integration of EIT with DEAs was examined to improve the mapping of compressive forces across the actuator electrode surfaces. Despite some trade-offs in accuracy due to electrode compliance, this approach offers promising advancements for applications requiring precise actuation and pressure mapping. This work has contributed towards filing a patent for an DEA-EIT actuator-sensor device. Additionally, the research has uncovered unintentional power generation in DEAs, which could function as Dielectric Elastomer Generators (DEGs) with mechanical strain inputs. This finding highlights the dual functionality of DEAs and suggests opportunities for energy harvesting applications. Finally, a portable, low-cost EIT-based hardware system for pressure mapping was introduced. This system enables comprehensive characterisation of various sensing domains and supports advancements in EIT-based soft sensor technology, with implications for biomedical devices, robotics, and energy harvesting. 
		
		Overall, this research advances the field of soft sensors by integrating EIT with innovative materials and technologies, providing new insights and applications in dynamic sensing and actuation.

		I'd like to thank many people who have implicitly and explicitly helped me get through my doctorate. 
		first the UC Bioengineering office including the Lung Ladies, Lung lads, IPC, Hamish for infinite Friday beers, Nic's abstract art. Also included in the office, Geoff Chase, for a constant stream of stories and advice always within earshot. The Mechanical Engineering post-grad office for baking, fruit, and comic relief. The UC Mechanical and Electrical department technicians for yarns and practical advice. All of the students I tutored and mentored keeping me on my toes throughout the doctorate. The motivation from all of my friends with the never ending question 'so... when do you finish', a very motivating and difficult question. However, I also couldn't have done it without the side jobs and adventures with colleagues and friends maintaining my sanity. A special thanks to my supervision and collaborations abroad, including my materials science work in IMDEA with Juan Jose and Anastasia and my time with with the MEiTNER soft robotics research group led by Markus Vorrath. Thanks to my internal supervision from Tim teaching me what PHD stands for and my co-supervisors Chris and Lui who have been a great source of yarns, advice, and general guidance. Finally, a big thanks to my partner Tess for her ongoing support and distraction from PhD work, and my family for their support.
